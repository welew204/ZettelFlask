    "Master the Art of Showing Up": {
      "text": "As a personal trainer and nutrition coach, I am often asked, What is the best workout to do for (fill in the blank: abs, legs, to lose weight, to get better at running, etc). Most of the time, the person asking hasnt been doing much in the way of physical activity in a while. Maybe they have thought about getting started many times, but they get stalled out trying to decide WHAT to do. What will be most effective?The truth of the matter is that when you are starting from a place of very little activity (i.e. sometimes you take the stairs instead of the elevator, but nothing much more strenuous than that on a consistent weekly basis) the specific program doesnt matter. As long as the exercise program you commit to a)includes functional human movements (i.e. task-driven, full-body),b)raises your heart rate,c)forces you to interact with objects that feel heavy for you, and d) gives some focus on waking up sleepy muscles (heres looking at you abs and glutes),youll see great results if you simply stick to it. Master the art of showing up. Three times per week. For about a year. That is all you need to focus on*.Of course, if you can bring a little curiosity and a sense of humor with you when you show up, that will go a long way But even if you show up in a foul mood. Or sore. Or tired. It will be better to have done something than nothing. It is important to honor your limitations, and it doesn't hurt to let your coach know how your body is feeling on any given day so that they can adjust accordingly :).What you are really doing in that first year of showing up is building a foundation of habit. The habit is like a mantra, in action: \"At least 3 times per week, I dedicate time to moving my body\". Carving out space for that in our hectic lives when we are not in the habit of doing it is a challenging task. There are a whole pile of things that will try to usurp the time you carve out for movement: work deadlines, family obligations, summer travel...you name itwe have run into it with our clients. The real task in the beginning is to consistently find that time for yourself. It will serve you better to show up to the gym and just move for an hour than to skip it all together. Why? Because it fulfills the primary goal: Show up, spend time moving.Protect that time.Master the art of showing up.*There are a few exceptions to the show up no matter what rule, but that is a post for another day",

    "Build a Foundation of Slow": {
      "text": "People like to move fast. They like to move fast even when there's no good reason to move fast. Between the notifications popping up on their phone all hours of the day and night and the BuzzFeed articles describing the life-changing benefits of Stupid High Intensity Training (S.H.I.T.), there is an over-urgency surrounding everything that seems important.But the reality is that most of the physical work we all need involves slowing down, at least part of the time. And while I like to tickle my chakras in yoga class, too, that's not exactly what I'm talking about. No, what I'm describing is about taking the time, often under intense loads and resistance, to gain understanding of where our bodies are in space.What IS my shoulder doing when I squat?         Hannah finds that happy \"shelf\" in the middle picture.    How does my neck move in a pushup?         The middle version has the most neutral (read: not \"pain-in-the...\") neck.    In practice, this slower work tends to be way more demanding than we expect, and offers that \"man I went to the gym today\" feeling that we all love so much but usually associate with just moving FAST and HARD. But whereas that faster work can often (and for beginners, USUALLY) go wrong in terms of movement quality, the slow stuff *feels* bad way before you get hurt; you have the ability to gauge and appropriately limit yourself.Now, don't get me wrong: I like pushing intensity as much as that chalk-eating, bro-hulk friend of yours (well maybe not QUITE as much). But like most things, the issue is not the general concept (intensity) but the dosage and quality, and there is real gold in letting things just settle.Slow down, pay attention, and let the changes start rolling in.",

      "text": "It certainly is easiest to think about fitness in bold cateogries. You know the kind I mean: \"Get RIPPED!\" \"Lose 12 pounds in 6 days\" \"12 Weeks to Huge Arms\".You'll notice that the one thing in common is that the result being offered is always a superlative, somewhat shocking,\"over there where the grass is greener\" kind of goal. In fact, they are all characterized by their END-goal.That's a big problem.Now, I don't doubt that some of those programs might get you the results if followed to a T--they might. And of course, those results might stick (or not) at the end of said program. But that's not what I'm writing about today.Today, I want to call out how backwards that kind of thinkingis when it comes to helping people improve.We can all agree that life happens in an up-and-down way, with some days feeling great and some just feeling like dogshit. Some days start well, and get worse; sometimes it's the opposite. And sometimes, everything is just normal (not that often, though). In fact, the onlyconstant is the change.But when someone decides that it's time to dig back into fitness, or get started for the first time, they are usually pretty adamant about rejecting where they are currently,their personal status quo, and they're ready to disrupt that status quo. Honestly, that desire to break things, smash the status quo,might be the ONLY thing they are sure about.They don't really know what to do--exercise? cardio? weights? yoga? how much? when? how long? are you my mother?!--which is why they need a coach! But they are damn sure that they want to change.\"Coach, make me better.\"As a coach trying to integrate with this amorphous collection of experiences and knowledge and wants and needs, my first job is to tune-in to their ups and downs. More than understanding what makes them \"tick\", I am trying to empathize with when they're feeling good, and when they're down. I'm trying to understand their status quo.As I start to understand their personal, unique undulating pattern of good/bad (their own personal wave), I start giving them little nuggets that are appropriate for where they are, that day, month, or year.Change is a process, not just another, greener pasture. Until you tune into where you are, you'll never get started in earnest.",

    "Good ouch or bad ouch?": {
      "text": "When you are just getting started with a fitness program, how do you know what is \"good\" pain or \"bad\" pain?More importantly, how do you know if you should push through it, or stop?When you are unused to regular exercise, it can be challenging to make this distinction at first. In the first week or so, everything might feel painful.Just the warm up might make you sweat. Every workout might make you sore. Maybe for days.          Then there is the loud chorus of fitspo messages urging you to push through-- No pain no gain Just do it Sweat is your fat crying --all of which imply that exercise SHOULD hurt, and that you should ignore all pain signals at any and all costs.We take a slightly different approach with our small group training clients. We believe that pain is your body giving you valuable information. We aim to help our clients learn to interpret this information, and begin to differentiate between \"bad\" pain--your body signaling that something is in fact wrong-- and \"good pain\" or what we like to call \"productive discomfort.\"Here are some some questions to run through when you feel pain during a workout that will help you determine if what you are feeling is PRODUCTIVE or DESTRUCTIVE.WHERE do you feel it?A) in the muscleB) in a jointC) I cant tellSensation in the muscle (A) is generally productive, and is something you want to learn to breathe through. Sharp shooting pain, or pinging pain in a joint (B), not so much. That is an indication that you should modify or skip that exercise for today, and seek an opportunity to learn more from your coach one-on-one. Sometimes you wont be able to tell (C), and thats when your coach can help by asking further questions to narrow down what might be happening, or, if needed, refer you to a physical therapist.WHEN do you feel it? example: Squatting hurts my knees!Does it hurtA) during the entire range of motion? i.e. as soon as you start moving downward and continuously until you return to standing?B) during a specific part of the movement, in this example it might be in the very bottom of the squatA is fairly uncommon, but would be an indication that we would want to skip that exercise until we can get more information. More often our clients who report pain with a particular movement feel it during a specific part of the movement (B).Going back to our squatting example, they might feel it at the bottom of the squat. This is great information, and lets us know we want to limit the range of motion for now, so that the client stays in the range of motion that is pain-free. However, we want to make a mental note that we need to work on increasing mobility and stability for that client to broaden their safe range of motion.HOW does the feeling change over time? As you do multiple reps of the exercise, does the sensationA) get worse or intensify with successive repetitions? B) stay the same with each repetition of the exercise?C) decrease in intensity with successive repetitions?If the answer is A. we will want to modify or change the exerciseIncreasing pain is most likely destructive. If the answer is B, we want to keep our awareness on the sensation, and monitor over time (how do you feel the day after the workout? Is the same sensation present the next time you encounter the same exercise next week? This could be productive discomfort, but only time and more information will tell! If the answer is C, that means we are in productive territory, and this movement is actually medicine for you! In this case, the sensation you feel is that of working out the kinks so to speak.You are the only one with the answer to these questions of Where, When & How. Once you share these answers with your coach, s/he can help you determine if the sensation is productive or destructive. This information is essential! It enables your coach to help you to stay safe, and dial in the intensity your workouts to a productive level.In other words, your coach can help you interpret the data, but you are the one who must collect and share it!",

    "Now that I'm working out, what should I eat?": {
      "text": "As folks get started with regular, intense, functional training, two questions come up time and time again: what should I eat before I workout? And, What should I eat after I workout?       Like most nutrition questions that are worth asking, the real answer to the pre/post workout meal question will be long-winded, nuanced and will reflect the specific needs and goals of the individual doing the asking. A bit more than I can cover in one blog post. In reality, the food-timing issue is a small fish compared to the much bigger and more important question: what works (nutritionally) for you?For the person just getting started (or re-started) with their fitness, addressing the basic building blocks of nutrition will have a far bigger impact than any changes to your so-called workout fueling. That means getting a handle on WHAT you are eating, HOW MUCH food you need, and what kind of PLAN will actually work for your lifestyle. In this post, I want to give a rough overview of the key components to pay attention to as you move toward a better nutritional approach, and some general recommendations that work for most people as they get started.Right off the bat, its worth exploring how your food intake affects your exercise experience. Food is often described as fuel by fitness people, but we dont really like that simplistic descriptor. Food is much, much more than simply the gas that makes you go (Thanksgiving dinner comes to mind), and our bodies are far more adept at utilizing food than a car is at using gasoline. Unlike machines, human bodies maintain incredible levels of function--physical and mental--in ever-shifting conditions and with broad types of intake: for every vegan athlete competing in 100+ mile races, there is the retired Army Ranger thriving on a single, daily serving of grass-fed beef--and nothing else. Heck, an obese male could probably survive for a year off of just his body fat alone, provided he had water to drink (and plenty of interesting stuff to keep him from going insane!).All this is just to say that given an adequate period of adjustment (and barring any significant abnormalities), we humans have choices when it comes how to best nourish ourselves. Anyone who adamantly disagrees with this and claims that there is only ONE way, is probably trying to sell you something. Whether we are talking about preparing ourselves for physical effort (pre-workout nutrition) or recovering from that effort (post-workout nutrition), each of us will feel and perform best when we find the personalized approach that reflects our lifestyle, our tastes, our physical demands, and the goals we have for our physicality.The first step, then, in figuring out how and what to eat pre- and post-workout is to start paying attention. How do certain foods make you feel under the stressful conditions of intense, functional training? How is your workout quality affected by that pre-workout banana? How about results--are you in fact losing the body fat that you were aiming to lose? All the best research in the world doesnt even come close to describing your own, personal experience in as intimate of detail as your own, thoughtful observation. In other words, YOU are the expert on you.Once you have those observations (we recommend keeping a journal, or some kind of record), the next step is to strategically experiment. That means a.) implementing a specific food with consistency for at least 2 weeks, b.) recording how it affects you as described above, and c.) stepping back to see its overall efficacy--how is it working? Rinse and repeat! Follow this process through enough iterations, and a nutritional approach that is uniquely optimal for you will gradually come into focus.Now, in practice, we have seen certain nutritional patterns repeat or overlap from person to person. Though the following guidelines are by no means the answer, they are a great framework to help you get started with your self-exploration:It is really, really easy to not drink enough water. Even if youre usually pretty good about drinking water, a single day of low fluid intake (I forgot my water bottle! is the classic excuse we hear...) can have outsize effects on your workouts, your recovery (sleep) and your general well-being. So drink up! Keep a reusable water bottle with you at all times.While most people will describe themselves as normal eaters of protein, their actual intake varies widely, as do specific needs (a 200lb guy who wants to put the hurt on in Jiu-Jitsu class has different needs than a 130lb woman who wants to lose 5 pounds of fat). Low protein intake can make you feel weak, sore, and even affect hormone levels in a not-so-fun way. On a daily basis, aim for at least 1 gram of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. This metric comes from the clinical world (thus the annoying conversion to metric), but is an excellent place to start.If theres one thing that about 99.4% of the fitness and nutrition coaching world can agree on it is this: vegetables rock, and you should eat them. Prioritize the leafy and green variety, but seriously, eat at least 2 big servings of veggies a day.Tell the low-fat voices in your head to shut the hell up. Proper fat intake is critical to literally hundreds of process body-wide, and it can be the difference maker for people with all types of goals from fat-loss to muscle gain and everything between. Aim for 2 thumb-size servings of healthy fats at every meal; as Coach Hannah says with loving insistence: Fear not the fat!Sugar should be an occasional treat, not a staple. This one is tough, as it runs contrary to the typical North-American diet, but it makes a really, really big difference. Limiting sugar helps you in so many ways, not least of which is feeling your true hunger cues--which helps you naturally manage portion size, and can be the difference-maker for people trying to lose body fat. On the performance side, athletes often report experiencing less soreness as their sugar (and overall carb) intake drops. Limit refined sugar intake to special occasions.Next time youre looking ahead to your next workout, and wondering how you should prepare for and recover from it, check and see if the items above are a regular part of your lifestyle. If you can make a small shift in most of your meals (and not just pre/post workout), youll notice big changes in your body and performance. Rather than feeling constricted to eating a super-specific thing pre- or post-workout, feel free to eat whatever you want! ...so long as it includes adequate protein, some veggies, healthy fat, and minimal refined sugar, alongside plenty of water (see what I did there?).As you can imagine, the hard part of any lifestyle change is not getting the right information--its implementing that information day in and day out. Staying disciplined and consistent over time is not an easy slam-dunk. Having a coach to guide your process can keep you on track, help you fine tune, and ultimately be the the differentiator between a moment of dieting and a lifetime of feeding yourself well. Our one-on-one nutrition coaching is dedicated to working with you where you are now in order to make big changes.

      "text": "         Lifting weights offers a profound opportunity to feel powerful in a real and literal way. You get to use your body to move objects that dont want to be moved. You get to find out how to leverage your limbs against heavy, inert hunks of metal, and create motion. This is a powerful experience for anyone who is feeling stuck. Feeling marginalized. Feeling like their voice and actions are not being heard in the larger conversation.Over the past 6+ years of working as a personal trainer, the most rewarding moments all distill down to the same essence: Making the impossible, possible. That moment when a client performs a task that they were once unable to perform. Examples vary widely, ranging from the obviously impressive--deadlifting their bodyweight, or doing their first strict pull-up--to the more subtle victories--squatting without knee pain, or touching their toes for the first time in years. For me personally, it was the first time I was able to press a weight overhead without shoulder pain.          Each of these moments is an opportunity to discover an expanded capacity within oneself.To see that with diligent practice, one can perform a task that was once impossible. How many arenas exist in our daily lives that allow this kind of experience? That allow us to challenge and transform ourselves in this particular way? Any opportunity that one has to do something that was once impossible, builds our belief that we can change things.That we are powerful.That limitations are not immutable.That resistance is a teacher, not a prison guard.Today I invite you to seek out such opportunities. Let the resistance  heavy objects, high bars, fear, discomfort, glass ceilings be your teacher in acquiring the skill of strength.I invite you to share your victories, set backs, and realizations in the comments. You are not alone. We are all in this together.",

      "text": "        Coach Hannah helping Whitney get the most out of a kettle bell rack hold.    We're in the business of changing bodies.Not overnight--that's called plastic surgery--and not just for looks (although that is definitely a goal for some of our clients). No, we are focused on one thing: working with you, now, where you are, to be better. Our clients range from the 60-year-old golfer (who moves past an elbow injury to lower his handicap) to the 28-year-old programmer (who told me last week that she is actually enjoying being active, \"for the first time, uh, ever\").Though our clients are diverse, with different starting points, different destinations, and different constraints on how to get there, they have two things in common: They are actively engaged in the change process, and they have a coach (well, two!).The first step in the coaching relationship is identifying each clients individual strengths and weakness (where are you NOW?). Then we discover what matters to them, body- and movement-wise (where do you want to GO?). This allows us to collaboratively define what success will look like, so that we can celebrate it when it happens. Then, day by day, we help our clients stay on that path, no matter where it winds.This process--of getting continuous, informed, and objective feedback in a way that you can actually apply--is the secret sauce that makes change happen in any realm, fitness or otherwise. This is how musicians become virtuosos, how entrepreneurs break through to the next stage, and how everyday humans actually change their bodies. Without consistency, nothing sticks long-term; without expertise and objectivity, you go in circles, never really moving forward.Every person who comes in to see us truly is different, and those differences need to be acknowledged. By personalizing your fitness--focusing on you--and then keeping you focused on the process, we make changing your body a reality.Are you ready to change?       Take the First Step    ",

    "Writing Your Own Workouts": {
      "text": "        ...follow the bouncing coach...    Excerpted from our \"Travel Workout Trailguide\" eBook--get your own copy by signing up for our newsletter HERE. Enjoy!--Writing a workout--any workout--is both a science and an art. Much like a recipe is designed to communicate the vast information needed for preparing a delicious dish, a written workout is intended to lay out the basics that one might need for a successful sweat session. Of course, just like recipes, the actual written information is just a starting point. Several different components can and should influence the final result.Success, in terms of exercise programming,is when that final result truly reflects the needs and wants of the person doing the actual workout(s). Oh, and you should finish feeling strong, mobile and \"worked\", too.Here are the basic components to keep in mind as you set out to write your own workouts.Lean toward movements and workouts that you know you can do well.Many people have fallen off the wagon because they have tried to do too much, too soon and realized it too late. A simple way to prevent this is to think of each workout as a building on the last, rather than trying to win the \"Most Exciting New Workout\" award every day. That is a recipe for injury, not success.Have an intention.\"Working out\" is one of those general terms that doesn't actually mean very much unless it's attached to a goal or intention. If you are training for a half-marathon, getting in your training runs should be your number one goal while travelling. If on the other hand, you are aiming for fat-loss, your hotel workout time should include some full-body strength training and some high-intensity drills. The more experienced you get, the better you'll be at honing in on what works for your goals, and what doesn't, but aimless working out is the fastest route to losing your fitness motivation.Be creative.While you definitely want to be smart with the movements you select (see above point), get creative with how you implement those movements. Completing 200 air squats and 100 pushups as fast you can might sound a little boring or daunting (or both!). What about if instead you went for a run, stopping to do 20 squats and 10 pushups at every stoplight, park bench or other landmark? Not so bad. We love all different organizational patterns to keep things fresh, and you can see some examples to get you started in the workouts of this book (WA #3, HG,WT #3).Let the circumstances inspire, not limit, you.It's easy to get attached to the movements, equipment and little, friendly details of your regular routine, and that routine is often very important for on-going success. However, the road will always present unforeseen circumstances that demand new and innovative solutions. If you can take those curveballs in stride, and fold them into your workout, you just might surprise yourself with your own strength and resourcefulness. That might mean doing pullups from a treebranch, using the stairs in your hotel for short, intense sprints, or even just trying out a new exercise class.Aim for 1% improvement, every day.Travel often means stressas all the little deviations from your personal normal add-up. When you are staring down a workout at the beginning or end of a long-day, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Instead, strive to improve yourself, in some way, by just 1%. Got 10 minutes? Great--that's enough time to warm-up, practice a few sets of pushups and lunges. Just start moving.3x52.Looking big picture, this is the only SETS X REPS scheme that really matters: 3 workouts per week for 52 weeks (that's 156 workouts). If you stay committed to consistently aiming for getting 1% improvement every workout, imagine what 156% improvement might look like!If writing and executing these \"successful workouts\" still seems daunting, then go ahead help yourself to one of the workouts found in this book. The more experience you have guiding yourself through workouts (even those written by us), the better you'll be at knowing what works for youand what kind of workouts youlike to do.Honestly, it's not the creation of the workout that's really the challenge. Instead, it's the awareness required to execute the workout well that determines people's true success, especially over the long-term. However, when circumstances require that you exercise on your own, or even come up with your own workouts, you simply must bring a higher degree of awareness and intention to your work, and thatis the secret ingredient to finding long-term fitness success.--Originally from our \"Travel Workout Trailguide\" ebook.

    "This Year, Let Your Garden Grow": {
      "text": "         Well, it's that time of year again.January.Resolution season. Blank slate, fresh start, New You! Also known as: where best intentions go to die.Sorry for the bleak perspective, but that's just reality for those of us in the Fit Biz.January is too often the time when lovely, admirable intentions are made (January 1), acted on (January 2) and then abandoned (January 5). By the end of the month, we're usually back to our regularly scheduled programming, and feeling very much like we did the year before.But for somepeople, that totally arbitrary line-in-the-sand that is January 1 actually kicks off a shift. The flip of the calendar page plants seeds that, with focus and perspiration, will bear tangible fruit for them. What makes these people different?Well, first, they have a plan. They have broken down their resolutions/visions/dreams into constituent steps, and laid out a path that connects those steps. They have systematically backtracked, from the new, shiny person that they imagine their 2017-selves to be, all the way back to who they are right now. What do the steps in between Now and New look like? Where will they be at the end of January? February? And most crucially, what will change immediately in service of their long-term, change-erific goal?That last question brings us to the second indicator: successful Resolutioners make the center-piece of their resolution an actionable goal that can start on January 2. However small it might be, they determine to enact a small, (usually) daily act of resistanceto their own status-quo. This is the gardener deciding to start weeding and pruning their garden every week, the artist deciding to sketch every day, or the yogi deciding to do 3 sun salutations every morning.They have found a tiny seam in their regular hum-drum, a tiny glimpse into the future, and they have resolvedto hone in on it with precision and doggedness.This is a huge step. Only by clarifying their grand notions into regular and actionable chunks--chunks that they can truly imagine baking into the rest of their lives--do these people enact actual change over the long haul.Finally, one more thing is at work for these Successful Resolutioners. They realize, sometimes for the first time, that even at their lowest, even when facing their biggest obstacle, they have one major factor foreverin their favor: change is already happening. It might be described generally, as entropy (the gradual and universal tendency toward chaos), or specifically (e.g. the protein-turnover of our muscles), but realize that life is progressing and evolving and changingall around us (despite us!),all the time.Successful Resolutioners harness that power. Like an experienced gardener, they have realized that progress looks more like cultivation than creation. Each day (and not just January 1) is a culmination of what has come beforeanda threshold into the opportunity of what comes next; our role as changers is to intervene only as much as that intervention helps.As a gardener myself, I love the garden as an analogy for change (and have written about it before). I love how succinctly it captures the magic of progress: given the right conditions, plants just grow. I think humans are the same.This perspective is not very mainstream these days, but it gets to the very center of a compassionate approach to changing yourself. Rather than seeing change as an abrupt and often violent departure from what came before (e.g. the gym newbie committing to 6am workouts every day), Successful Resolutioners see change as the evolving growth-process that it always--and I do mean always--is.So this year, while we're still in this fertile valley of January,I encourage you to take stock of your plans for change. Are you acting out a plan, or just hoping that change happens? Are you enacting that change with microscopic, daily resistance to your personal normal? And finally, are you appreciating the constant Forward that governs our lives, and harnessing that power? If those pieces are in place, then your garden is in great shape heading into 2017, and I look forward to seeing what it yields!",

    "Kitchen Alchemy: TFA Chicken Soup": {
      "text": "        Easy and delicious Chicken Soup. See recipe below.    Over lunch the other day, while enjoying the homemade chicken soup (recipe included here),Hannah and I got to talking about how inspired we get by food that just seems to fall together--easily, cheaply, nutritiously. In this case, two rotisserie chickens (one of our favorite quick grabs), bought to make curried chicken salad the week before, had then become homemade bone broth (or, pretty much the healthiest thing you can make in your own kitchen...), and that broth had become this soup.No recipes were involved (because I had made both of these meals several times previously), and each meal--the curried chicken salad and the soup--flexibly incorporated \"whatever was in the fridge\". I spent about $25, and ~1.5 hours of TOTAL prep time. Not bad for 8+ healthy meals!Honestly, I believe that too many people get mired in the details of cooking, and in the process lose site of what's really important to them, their lives, and their goals. They might start with great intentions, but things get complicated and they end up turning away from the cooking question entirely...and go pick up fast-food. And yes, fast-food will always be the easiest option. But between slaving away in a kitchen and eating food that will literally shorten your life-span, there exists a better way. It's a way that is open to change and adaptation, tastes great, and will sustain a long and healthy life.         *not a TFA recommended exercise    The recipe below is meant to be one such \"way\", a guide that lays out not just one specific meal to make, but an approach that is as flexible as you need it to be. Because while each person will need a little different guidance on the cooking front, the \"end\" is the same for all of us: the ability to pull-off delicious, affordable (time and money)and super-nutritious meals multiple times a week (and then live on the leftovers!). With that skill in hand, we start to see people putting together weeks, and months, of consistently nutritious eating.And progress--no matter the goal--just seems to \"magically happen\" when you're working on it consistently.Enjoy!--TFA Chicken Soup: A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure \"Recipe\"(~6 servings, 1hr)2 TB bacon fat, butter, coconut oil or ghee1 onion, roughly chopped4-6 carrots, roughly chopped (opt.)4-5 stalks celery, roughly chopped (opt.)6 cups chicken or beef stock/bone-broth (preferably homemade)at least 1 pound of assorted vegetables (mushrooms, cabbage, peas, kale, peppers, etc.)2-3lbs chicken thighs or breast, roughly choppedsalt and pepper to tasteGarnish with fresh herbs (cilantro, parsley, basil), jalapenos, and hot sauceChoose ONLY 1 of the following flavor combinations (customize to your heart's content!):Chinese2 TB minced garlic (about 4 cloves)2 TB minced ginger (a 1-in cube, peeled)1 tsp sesame oilone stalk lemongrassadded later - 1/4 cup soy sauceadded later - 1/4 tsp Red Boat Fish Sauce (opt.)Mexican1 TB oregano1 TB ground cumin1 TB chili powder3 cloves of garlic, smashed and mincedadded later - 1 14oz can of diced tomatoesFrench1 TB dried thyme1 TB dried basil1/4 cup fresh minced parsleyHeat up oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat; when hot, add onion and carrot. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add flavoring ingredients (Chinese, Mexican or French), stir, and cook until very fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add stock and other ingredients if using (soy and fish sauce, or tomatoes)and bring to a boil. Turn down heat to low--but make sure the soup is still slowly boiling--and cook for 10min.Taste for seasoning (be liberal with salt and seasoning, as the veggies and chicken will make the soup more bland), then add your veggies and stir to combine. Finally, add chicken and slowly boil for 10min. Turn off heat, cover and let the soup finish for an additional 25min. Garnish and enjoy!Comment and let us know which flavor combo is your favorite!",

      "text": "a story of conquering knee pain          Dee is a ray of sunshine. Even when she has had a frustrating day (and believe me, she has been handed some doozeys in the time that I've known her), she is excited to be at the gym, and her amazing attitude is infectious.When we first met, Dee was often walking with the use of a cane, due to arthritis in her knees and a torn meniscus that was never treated. She was in varying amounts of pain daily.Today she is deadlifting, squatting, pushing the sled, and being an all-around functional fitness badass. When we sat down for a one-on-one check in, she shared with me her most personally meaningful physical accomplishment: she is climbing the two flights of stairs to her house without pain, and without holding on to the railing.          I'll let her take it from here:   I originally met Hannah at a business meeting and although I was there for other reasons I gravitated to her great energy. We scheduled some time to meet over coffee and talk shop about both of our businesses, but somehow I ended up talking mostly about my fitness needs. You see, I have a torn meniscus in my right knee and degenerative arthritis in both knees and Ive had some real challenges walking, so I wanted to work with people who would care about my needs.That was 7 months ago and I now have very little discomfort in my knees, Ive lost weight and I am working out regularly w/people who pay attention to my physical limitations. I started with 1-on-1 sessions and over the last couple of months have moved to small group sessions and even though I sometimes feel like Im not as advanced as some of the others Hannah and Will always find a way to help me go the extra mile and stretch myself. They make sure we have travel workouts available, they schedule sessions for our family to work out with us and arrange the schedules to fit our needs. Not to mention, both of them have a knack for making sure each person feels included and that their workout is important. My life has been completely changed because of the Fitness Alchemists (Will & Hannah) and Im so very thankful for their work with me. Ive literally readjusted my life to make sure I get my workout in and Im grateful for the support I get as a result. Ive made an investment in myself and God aligned the universe for the right people to help me make good on that investment.   We are so proud of you, Dee!If this story resinates with you, please don't hesitate to reach out. Whatever has been holding you back, we can help.

    "Kitchen Alchemy: Every Day is Taco Tuesday": {
      "text": "Taco bowls are the best, you guys. Easy? Check. Delicious? Check. Packed with nutrients? Check. Customizable to your hearts content? Check. Best of all, you can whip one up in under 20 minutes. Here's how...          I first started making them back in 2010, when I realized I had a gluten sensitivity. If you are following a gluten-free, low-carb, or Paleo diet, or if you are just trying to eat more real food and less processed food, the Taco Bowl is your ticket to feeling full and satisfied.Heres my formula...1. Start with a big a$$ bowl.Like, one you could fit your whole face in.2. Fill your bowl to the half-way point with leaves.Leaves? Yes, leaves. Green leafy vegetables are an essential component of human health. This is something ALL diet philosophies can agree on. The darker green, the more nutritional benefits. You can choose from eitherA) Raw leaves  these work well and require almost no prep (Except washing):LettuceArugulaBaby SpinachDress your raw greens with a little EVOO, lime juice, and salt.orB) Cooked leaves:Roasted Brussels sproutsSauted Cabbage (red or green)Braised Kale or collard greensRoasted KaleWilted SpinachNote: This is great opportunity to use leftovers!3. Cook up your Protein of choice + Taco Seasoning:Grassfed ground beefthis is my go-to protein choiceGround turkeyHeat your skillet to medium-high. Melt 1tsp of your fat of choice (my faves are clarified butter, coconut oil or bacon fat) add your taco seasonings to the pan (use a pre-made blend, or combing equal parts Cumin and Chili Powder, with a few dashes of garlic powder.Crumble in the ground meat with your hands, and stir like you mean it to combine seasonings thoroughly. Keep stirring, and breaking apart chunks, until there are no pink parts left. Immediately turn off the heat once the last pink has disappeared, because dry meat is not the championship.Now it's time to add salt + pepper to taste. The \"to taste\" part is really important--TASTE your meat. If it doesn't taste AMAZING, you probably need to add a little more salt. Salt will activate the other spices and flavors --read more about the essential role of salt.Let skillet contents rest as you assemble your other ingredients.4. Add Toppings!!!I've put a * next to the ones that I personally ALWAYS include and view as essential, but this whole section is really where personal taste comes in.Salsa* (I am particularly fond of the Salsa Authentica from Trader Joes)Sliced Scallionsthinly sliced radishesPickled red onionsCheese* (my fave is aged cheddar, but you could get super authentic up in here with some Cotija.)sour creamavocodo or guacamolefresh cilantro*fresh diced tomatoessliced jalapenoshot sauce* (i love The Pepper Plant Pepper Sauce--like if you were stranded on a desert island what would you bring type love)         Pan seared fish tacos, with black beans, cilantro, lettuce, grated cheddar cheese, aioli, salsa, sauteed onions, cherry tomatoes, avocado.    Just to recap, your essential ingredients are:Ground meat (beef or turkey)Taco SeasoningSea SaltLeaves (raw or cooked)Fat for cooking (ghee, coconut oil, bacon fat)Toppings of choice (See list above)5. Grab a fork and dig in.Savor the amazing variety of flavors and remember how good life really is. We would love to see what kind of taco bowl variations you create.

      "text": "         This week marks the beginning of a new phase in exercise programming for the Fitness Alchemists. As a fitness company, the choice of exercises in our workouts is central to who we are; it is quite literally whatwe do, and one of the main ways that we express what we believe to be important about training bodies to be strong. In an effort to \"pull back the curtain\", this blog is about why, what, and howthese workouts are structured and organized, and what this means about our company. WHYFitness is, on its face, about helping people achieve real, meaningful changes to their bodies, health, and capabilities. It's about improving weaknesses, functioning better, and living more richly. With that promise, fitness grabs our collective attention as an alluring and fulfilling goal, something worth investing real time, money, and focus.As with any investment, we care about the results; in fact, the more we invest, the more we care.Of course, we care about the \"return\" on our investment--what has changed--but, because it's oursweat turning the crank,we also care how it feels getting there. So if we care so much, and have invested so deeply, shouldn't we also care about the tools we're using to get there?We think so. Our bodies are incredible--amazing, shape-shifting, task-switching, adaptive machines--and will respond to nearly any stress that we're exposed to. However, making sure that stress-response is the same change that we wanted in the first place (stronger, healthier, richer life) means three components must be treated carefully:Direction of progress must be clearly established. This means that the trainer(s) and trainee have agreed on what a successful return on their investment will look like, 6 months or more down the road. This is why we are adamant about bringing all of our trainees on board with a thorough 1-on-1 assessment, and why we meet 1-on-1 with clients throughout their training.Progress must be real. There's already plenty of bluster and fake-news in the world, and your sweaty, consistent effort need not add to it. Instead, let the cold, hard numbers of regular re-assessment do the talking, and relax knowing that your growth process is truly managed (and not just given lip-service).Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum. Real people, with real lives, must learn to expect the unexpected and plan to be surprised. Therefore, one sign of a smart training approach is that it takes unpredictability into account, and streamlines accordingly. While we might be inclined to try and \"do it all\" (in the gym or in our lives), a much better approach is to choose the most important components and commit to them.We designed our new programming engine (it's an algorithmic web-app) to synthesize these demands. WHATThis tool generates multi-month cycles of weekly workouts that judiciously allocates training time to the specific parameters we've defined (and that we've committed to assessing), while leaving space for the in-session, day-to-day flexibility required by our real-lives/real-bodies. Striking that balance is no small task. In fact, that balance is thething that matters if you care about long-term, substantive change.Speaking of change, the challenges that people face are not for lack of trying. Step into a gym anywhere in the world and there will be three kinds of people:People who are doing a bunch of random sh*t: These folks have achieved the first and most challenging task: showing up. Beyond that, they are rolling the dice on their investment. This group includes 75% of group-fitness class attendees, as well (as former group-class instructors, you can trust us on this one). This group has sometimes been been duped by the \"you have to keep your body guessing\" Workout Confusion Theory approach to training.People who are following a plan: These trainees have committed themselves to something longer-term, something progressive, something strict. Assuming that commitment is toward something that is meaningful for them (actually, a very difficult thing to measure/observe), the challenge with this approach is three-fold: motivation (executing this kind of plan, alone, takes a lot of will-power), flexibility (what if things don't go according to plan), and program drop-off (\"Ok, I've finished the plan! ... What now?\"). Just having a plan doesn't mean your progress is automatic.People who intuitively and continuously improve: These are usually the most-experienced trainees, people who have been around the block (and seen their share of dead-ends, injuries, and time-sucks). Three or four times a week, they show up, listen to their bodies, and push themselves (or hold back) accordingly. Through years of consistent training, they know what works and what doesn't, and like the Earth moves around the sun, they make progress.We built our programming engine as a tool to help bridge the gaps between these three distinct groups. By combining the strict, quantifiable results of a plan (group 2) with a flexible, quality-focused approach (and expert coaching), we help those in group 1, who are a little lost in their fitness-lives* learn to train in the intuitive way of that compelling third group.While the actual workouts may vary greatly from day-to-day (and won't feel much different from previous workouts to our current clients), they are now guided with precision to get right to the important stuff, as efficiently as possible. HOWSo, here's our formula for success:          Like any tool, this new programming engine is only effective in the right hands. By combining the tuned-in, emotionally-intelligent coaching that The Fitness Alchemists are known for with a way of generating workouts that reflects what is actually important, we can be sure that clients are given their best chance to succeed. Letting the computer do the detailed work of balancing inputs and crafting schedules means that our coaches have more band-width and energy to help clients with that critical \"doing it well\" component.Curious about what making real changes feels like?

    "Holiday Nutrition Triage": {
      "text": "A survival guideHow do you stick to good nutrition during the holidays? Especially when you are traveling to stay with family and you have little to no control over what food is available?Triage.What do I mean by Triage?Triage (v): the assigning of priority order to projects on the basis of where funds and other resources can be best used, are most needed, or are most likely to achieve successIn short, it means doing your best in the given circumstances.Perfect nutrition doesn't exist, unless you live in a vacuum. Most of us have to interact with real-world circumstances. Even if we have become adept at navigating the \"real-time\" ups and downs of our everyday lives, things like holiday travel and the food-based events contained therein can throw a serious wrench in our gears. The key is to limit the disruption, while still taking part in the traditions.There are three steps in the Nutritional Triage process:Know your personal nutrition principles (PNPs)Assess the available optionsChoose the best option, given the circumstances, to keep you in alignment with your commitment to your goal.PNPs will be based on your goal(s) and what works for you. For example, my goal is to maintain my weight, and maximize my energy. My PNPs are:Palm sized portion of Protein with every mealGreen leafy vegetables at least 2x/dayLimit sugar & refined carbohydratesEat mostly whole unprocessed foodsNo gluten (not because I believe being gluten free makes you holy, but because it destroys my insides. If it doesn't destroy your insides, eat up! No moral judgements from me.)As you can see, I'm already a fairly moderate nutritionista. That's because I've found that too much rigidity actually works against me. I get real mad if there are too many rules and end up overeating the wrong stuff just to prove that rules aren't the boss of me. Which is not the championship. So, I moderate.You might do better with strict guidelines, and that's cool too. Studies have shown that people are either moderators OR abstainers -- for more on that (including a quiz to help you figure out which camp you belong to) check out Gretchin Rubin's work. She's smart and funny and has done a TON of research on knowing yourself, habit formation and increasing happiness through practical actions.SO:Whatever your PNPs, you can still follow the triage thought process to help you navigate eating well during the holidaze.          PreparationAs much as you can, plan ahead. I always bring snacks with me when I travel, and if I'm going to be away for 5+ days with uncertain access to grocery stores and little to no control over where the family goes out to eat, I like to cover a few bases with some non-perishables.Protein powder (In a zip lock bag so it takes up very little space)Raw, unsalted nuts (I prefer pecans, walnuts, or almonds--in that order) - not picturedWhole-food bars e.g. RX Bars, Epic bars, or Perfect BarsSupplements (I take fish oil and vitamin B12 daily)Digestive enzymes (the chewables from Trader Joe's are great! Though not pictured)Water bottleAll of this takes up less space than a pair of shoes, and will help me stick to my principles, keep my digestion on track, avoid hangry tantrums, etc. But most importantly, it will help me hold onto a consistent habit, a key factor in long-term health outcomes (BOOM. <---Science.).Flying is super dehydrating--this is part of the reason many of us have trouble staying regular with our elimination when we travel. (Yes, I'm talking about poop.) Bring a water bottle and fill it up once you get through security--many airports have nice water bottle refilling stations with filtered water. Then all that's left to do is drink up! I aim to finish my 40oz klean kanteen by the time I land. Then I can fill it up on the other and and keep sipping on the ride from the airport ;)In general, you want to aim to drink at least half your bodyweight in ounces per day. More active folks need even more!Triage for Dining OutTake a deep breath. Eating out is not an automatic sign to switch into Eat-Like-A-Kid mode.You know what I'm talking about.First,take your time reading the menu. See what most appeals to you, and also scan for things that fit within your current nutrition principles. Ideally there will be some overlap, but sometimes that's not the case. In those instances, I try to strike a balance of getting what I need, and allowing some extra fun stuff that will please my palate. 'Cause food should taste good, goddamnit!Also, ask for adjustments. Most American-style restaurants will make quick swaps of sides (i.e. steamed broccoli on place of mashed potatoes, side salad for fries). As a gluten intolerant person, I've learned you can even ask for sandwiches on a bed of lettuce instead of bread--most places will oblige you (even if they do so with a raised eyebrow).When you can, use Yelp or a Google search of restaurants in your area to find spots that will have good options for you and be proactive about suggesting a place that will accommodate your nutritional needs. In my experience, large family gatherings give in to inertia. No one wants to be the one to choose for the whole group, for fear that people won't like their suggestion but will go along with it anyway. This leads to just following historical precedent, and eating at \"that place we went last year.\" What I've found? People are more than glad to follow someone else's direction, as it saves them from being the decision-maker. So step up, and choose well!Triage for Dining InThis may be the hardest place to stay in alignment with your personal nutrition principles. You're at a relative's house, and there's tons of social pressure to partake in the meal they spent time preparing for you and the other guests. Especially around holiday time, there can be an added layer of guilt-tripping: \"we only make this once a year\"(...so you better enjoy it 'cause we're going to, and if YOU don't then WE might feel guilty).Holy minefield, batman.In order to tread carefully in these situations, I tend to take a small helping of the prized dish, and enjoy it slowly and mindfully, aiming to stop eating it once it no longer tastes as AMAZING as the very first bite. Read more about the brilliant \"First Bite Rule\"on Neghar Fonooni's blog. This way I am able to be part of the group activity, honor my host, and also limit my deviation from my PNPs. Not to mention I get to deeply enjoy a delicious treat!Let the guilt go.The holidays can be stressful enough with family dynamics, travel logistics, and lack of routine. There's no need to add stress to the system by piling on guilt. Trust your triage, enjoy your splurges mindfully...the End.In the end, sometimes the best therapy is in realizing that the struggle is real, and that there are other people fighting similar battles. Like me!If you want to follow along, I'll be posting examples of my own personal holiday nutrition triage on our Instagram feed (follow us @thefitnessalchemists).Want some specific advice on your choices?

    "Make Your Mornings Suck Less": {
      "text": "Part 1Hi team, Coach Hannah here.I need to come clean with you about something: I am NOT a morning person.A year ago, if you had told me that I would willingly get up at 5:30am Monday through Friday I would have laughed you out of the room.And yet.I do. (Im putting the finishing touches on this email at 6:18 am)How the hell did I become a \"morning person\" ???I did not start out this way, kiddos. For those who know me, you know I love to sleep. I do best with 8+ hours per night, every night. So Im not making mornings happen by sacrificing sleep. Mama dont play that sleep dep game. Im hilarious when sleep deprived, but otherwise non-functional and I quickly get overwhelmed and think that the world is terrible and everything is wrong and it will never get better so lets just eat M&Ms and potato chips until we die.Yeah.I start teaching at 6:30am. That means I need to be a) Alert b) Articulate and C) Charming AF by 6:30 in the freaking morning.When this first became the truth of my professional existence, I resisted the early rise kicking and screaming. I would sleep until the LAST possible minute, roll outta bed already wearing workout clothes that Id slept in, make coffee while barely conscious, and then bomb down the road to the gym riding my bike as fast as I could.And it worked. Kinda.The Ill-be-late-if-I-dont-pedal-as-fast-as-humanly-possible bike ride got my heart (and adrenaline) pumping. The coffee in my thermos gave me confidence that I would be able to string sentences together in front of my clients. And I told myself that sleeping as late as possible was the only sane thing to do, because getting up before 7am is just cruel so you should mitigate that shit as much as possible.But during this year a funny thing happened. I began to resent my clients. Even though they were people I loved working with, I noticed my patience getting thinner and thinner. To the point where I was thinking about switching careers.I wasnt happy.Then I heard about this book on a podcast called The Miracle Morning - if that sounds hokey to you, you are right on point.I still cant, in good conscience, recommend the book itselfthe tone of the writing is the worst self-help-salesman-sunshine BS you can imagine. OMG its seriously the worst.But.I was so unhappy that I was willing to try anything, so I ordered the book on amazon, convinced my S.O. to do it with me, and we started our Miracle Morning adventure.Begrudgingly at first, we put the principles outlined in the book into practice.The principles (Which I CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend, as as follows):Get up an hour earlier than you need toPreset a sequence of actions that will kickstart you into being awake (drink a glass of water, brush your teeth)Do 10 minutes each of 6 practices that are known to improve your happiness, and in turn your life (movement, meditation, journaling, visualization, reading, and affirmation)*Go about your day.*I have since modified WHAT I do in that morning time, as I found that for me personally I feel rushed trying to cram in just 10 mins of each thing, but the habit ofgetting up early and doing something for myself first thing in the morning has stuck.WHY?My work revolves around caring for other people. Being what they need for the hour that we are together. I know many of you can relate to this, even if your line of work is different in name, most of us SERVE OTHERS in our work. Parents really know what Im talking aboutyou take care of tiny humans before you even GO to work. Bless you.The old way I ran my life meant that I was taking care of other people from my first conscious moment until late afternoon. The first time I would do anything purely for myself was 5-6hrs into my day, when I already felt depleted.This new routine flipped the order: I was taking care of MYSELF first thing, before I even thought about another human being.Turns out putting yourself first is a powerful thing.Just a week into implementing this new morning ritual, I felt clear headed. At that point, by body wasnt yet agreeing to the new sleep schedule, which meant I was staying up later than Id like and getting only 6-7hrs of sleep per night. But even with less sleep,I felt more rested. More calm. My patience came back. Stuff that used to make me feel overwhelmed suddenly seemed manageable. I actually wondered why I had been so stressed out.Putting myself first changed the game.Instead of feeling like a martyr who was sacrificing herself for the good of her flock, I felt like a whole person who was living by my principles. I no longer felt like a fraud.Taking time out for yourself feels selfish (in theory, when you think about it) but it has turned out to be the most generous action I can take on a daily basis.I thought 5am was the problem. That the literal time was so early as to force an unpleasant start to the day. I was so wrong. It was the quality of my experience that made the morning suck. Rushing, feeling stressed, being down to the wire with no time for mistakes.What do we love about weekend mornings? Its not the extra sleep. Its not that 10am is magical. Its that we allow ourselves the experience of waking up and responding to our own needs or even whims  before we go on about our day. We do that naturally on days that we dont have to be anywhere at a specific time.Now that I understand that, Im pretty confident that I could adjust to any wake up time (4am, 9am  whatever) as long as I set myself up to have the experienceI need to start my day well.If this resonates with you, but youre like, how do I start? I get it. It's a process. It probably took me a year to get my morning routine (and appropriate bed time) dialed in.We are thinking about making a video to help you start your morning with a little self love and joint care via simple movements that anyone can do. It would be a \"do-along-with-me\" video, and we are thinking 10 minutes max, so you can start small.Would you use that if we made it?Reply in the comments and say ay.Top of the morning to ya,HannahP.S. This story went out to the awesome folks on our email list. If you want to hear more like it, sign up to get our emails. They're like a yoga class for your mind.P.P.S Update as of March 19th, 2018 - we made that video we mentioned, you can get yourself a copy here.",

    "Make Your Mornings Suck Less: Part 2": {
      "text": "Hi team, Coach Hannah here.If youre not a morning person, and you are forced to get up earlier than feels natural to your body (looking at you, teacher friends) it can be rough. As I talked about in my last email, you can start to deeply resent the people you serve in your work.Which is not the jam.So many of you replied to my last email - I had no idea mornings were such a struggle for so many of you! But Im glad you piped up, cuz Ive got more make-your-morning-not-suck emails coming your way.And we are working on a quick video you can do along with us to help you get moving and set you on the right foot for a freaking fantastic day. More on that later this week.Today, Im going to reveal my #1 secret to pushing past the grouchy bit and finding a way to be bright and shiny by the time you actually have to interact with people.You know how sometimes when you are really sad, or really angry, the feeling will get so absurdly big that youll find yourself laughing hysterically?Just me?Well. Laughter, my friends is the key for me.When Im still feeling grumpy about being awake, even after moving and meditating, I listen to stand-up comedy on Pandora.I have a few go-to stations, based on my favorite comedians. Pandora pulls together choice bits from various comedians they think youll like based on the person you love. Its brilliant! As a side bonus, Ive found comics I didnt know about.Short bits are perfect for morning grumpsville. You dont have to get too involved, youre not listening to a whole hour. If you miss one, cuz youre electric toothbrush drowns out the sound of your phone, no biggie. You can pick up with the next bit.Also its generally all the BEST bits from each comic, so you dont have to wade through the kinda boring set ups to get to the real payoff.Once Im laughing, I cant be mad anymore.Some of my favorite stations to get the day started are:Robin Williams (listening to that dude is like 8 shots of double espresso - he thinks and talks so fast! And makes me laugh so hard I cry)Maria Bamford (absurd, sneak-attack funny)Jackie Kashian (family friendly side-splitting smart silly stuff)But you should listen to YOUR favorites.This is the whole thing: Pair something unpleasant with something pleasant. Prefereably a pleasant thing that changes you, physically (laughing/smiling). See when you laugh, it forces you to BREATH. And breathing makes everything better.Giggle and get going,Hannah",

    "Make Your Mornings Suck Less: Part 3": {
      "text": "Good morning! Hannah, here.Nothing like daylight savings to remind us of a universal truth:It is harder to get going in the DARK.Seriously. Doesn't it just feel wrong to get up before the sun? Even though I am now in the habit of getting up before sunrise, it's always much nicer to walk out the door to a little bit of light in the sky.Oh well. It will be back in a few weeks.But this brings me to one of the key things you can do to make getting up early suck less: Get the right alarm clock.As I mentioned in my first emailabout mornings, when my S.O. and I finally agreed to do early mornings together, we treated ourselves to a new alarm clock.But my phone is my alarm clock, Hannah!Yeah, I know. But does your phone wake you up gently by slowly brightening your room? Mine sure doesn't.But my alarm clock does.See, it's a light.Say you wanna wake up at 6:30am. You set your alarm clock, and it will start slowly brightening your bedroom from 6:15-6:30am, so that by the time your alarm goes off, your room is filled with (artificial) sunlight. Ta da!If this isn't a great example of faking it til you make it, I don't know what is.Another bonus of having a legit alarm clock is that you can leave your phone out of the bedroom. This helps on both sides of sleep:At night: We ALL know that we shouldn't be staring at screens prior to bed if we want high quality sleep. If you haven't heard this yet, you're late aaaaaaaand welcome to 2018. We're delighted to have you.In the morning: the surest way to NOT get out of bed and do all the great things you had planned for yourself is to lay there scrolling through social media/news/whatever on your phone. WE ALL DO IT.If your phone is your alarm clock, it is ALMOST impossible to resist the siren call of those notifications on your home screen when you turn your alarm off. You know I'm right.Leave your phone in the living room. Read a paper book before bed. Get an alarm clock. Thank me next week.But seriously. Looking back at my journey to becoming a morning person (resentfully, slowly,now joyfully) one of the things that made an immediate difference in my waking mood and ease of physically getting out of bed was this stupid alarm clock.I almost don't expect you to believe me because I remember the way I felt before I got mine and I wouldn't have believed me then either.But enough of you asked, so I'm sharing what worked for me!-Hannah",

    "Becoming Fluent, part I": {
      "text": "I love dissecting simple things to see their complexity. But sometimes, I like thinking about complex things as simply as possible. Like what to do when your body hurts.*Everybody hurts, at some point. Spend enough time doing anything and you'll get hurt doing it, at some point. It is one of the ways our bodies learn, and critical to keeping us safe, because it's the alarm system that let's us know when danger is near.But it also creates a lot of strife, and keeps a lot of people from engaging with the world in a physical way. Becoming fluent in how you communicate with your body means that you are not just terrorized by the alarm, but also tuned in for the good stuff--strength, pleasure, flow--as well.In the last couple decades, understanding of pain at the physiological level has led to a huge jump ahead in the world of \"pain science\". Basically, scientists have found lots of evidence that supports the notion of pain as the result of several factors interacting in the brain, resulting in a \"bio-psycho-social model\" of pain.*Of course, this makes a lot of common sense: what physically happens to our body (bio), AND how we think about it (psycho), AND how others treat us (social) will all effect the actual, physical experience of pain.At the same time, with all of those confounding factors, the potential complexity of pain can be overwhelming. Yes, sometimes there is a clear Cause and Effect (like: trip, fall, fracture wrist); but usually it's way, way more complicated. And it's more complicated mostly because how we THINK about our pain, how we manage the mental-game, actually does have a result on our physical experience.The problem is that most of us are just not that good at managing our minds, especially when it comes to thinking about our bodies.So, what CAN we do when our bodies hurt? I have a few ideas ;) that I will be sharing over the next few weeks, so stay tuned. You can bet they have to do with CARs, but also meditation, heavy breathing, big-ass kettlebells, and cold showers...In the meantime, I'm curious what YOU do when something hurts? When a new pain jumps out at you, or an old pain nags, how do you think about it? How do you manage your pain-experience? How do you help others in pain?Seriously, hit me back!*I'm not a doctor (and I don't play one on TV), and none of this is medical advice. If you are in pain, you should be already talking to a medical professional. Then come back and read more soothing thoughts on pain science, movement and self-care :).",

    "CARs, or How to Make Your Body Go VROOM": {
      "text": "Coach Will here to talk about CARs: Controlled Articular Rotations.I have an irrational fondness for this exercise, and I want to tell you why. I have a lot to say--probably too much--but I wanted to lay it all out.One of my favorite aspects of working with humans and their bodies is that I get to interact with human realness. I'm pretty sure \"realness\" is not a real word.But I bet you understand what I mean: realness is that base layer of our experience, where we have actual feelings and are actually weak and vulnerable. It's also where we are actually strong and beautiful, too. It's a cool place, even if things do get a little real at times :).In the gym, the \"real\" aspect is pretty obvious: I have the chance to see, feel, challenge and support physical bodies, in real-time. Regardless of histories, goals, or opinions, the simple reality of how someone's joints work, one-at-a-time and in larger patterns, is made plain to me, and so I might know better how to help that person. I love that interaction.At the same time, there's another even more realinteraction going on: between the mover-student and themselves. Somewhat problematically, that conversation is not always the most polite (and sometimes is pretty darn harsh). I say \"problematically\" only euphemistically: it's one of the most damning obstacles that we see, day in and day out.Imagine for a moment the preposterous complexity of the human organism: 60,000 miles of nerves (potentially) conduct 1,000,000,000,000,000 (that is 1 quadrillion. 15 zeros. I read it somewhere, I think from Hunter Cook) impulses across the brain each second, creating more neurological connections than there are particles in the known universe. That's a lot of complexity to sort out and understand, let alone process into powerful, willful movement (Ha! Will-ful!).But now multiply that by all the ways our consciousness might make thingsmorecomplex. Like by: deciding that certain movement-sensations are \"right\" or \"wrong\"; or by repressing the shame you feel in certain physical positions or places; or by trying to guess what others may or may not be thinking about you. Seeing and feeling what's actuallygoing on in your body becomes a devious, frustrating task.Fortunately, we have found tools that works on that particular ability, of seeing-feeling what is real in your body. They're called Controlled Articular Rotations, or CARs for short.They ask for you to make the largest pain-free rotation of a single joint in your body while keeping all other joints still. Simple!Simple, sure,but not easy.First, CARs demand that you practice the of holding strong, of not moving; this takes huge energy and tension, but yields an equally rich flow information to your brain (more muscular tension = more nerve feedback).Second, CARs demand an inquisitive awareness of simplified movement, at the specific joint your moving. Continuously comparing the non-movement of your body with the controlled movement of that single joint gives you an honest view of what is actually true in your body,today.Third, this enhanced awareness is only temporary. It opens up a window in which, with more information, the movement part of your brain is able to make better decision, and you become an intrinsically better mover. For a day or so.So, to recap:CARs are an incredible way to bring clarity to your unique physical puzzle (your body), if you can 1. work hard, 2. pay attention and 3. be consistent.That's why we recommend ALL of our clients do them EVERYDAY. It's why I do them every morning (except Saturdays. Because, Saturdays!), and why we start every class with them.It's also why we put together a morning CARs routine video guide, called 10 Minutes of Morning Alchemy. By showing you what CARs look like, talking you through them, and being there everymorning (on your smartphone/computer, at least) we might get you to ACTUALLY start doing them :). Imagine being the person who spends a little time every morning getting sorted, inside and out...Be well, folks!",

    "Becoming Fluent, part II": {
      "text": "Welcome to part two of Becoming Fluent, or how to become a better \"listener\" to your body (and unlock your MOST impactful tool for physical improvement, achievement, etc). If you missed Part 1 you can check it out here.OK, so that was a bold statement up there ^(\"...MOST impactful..\"), but I stand by it because learning to pay better attention to your bodyis a master-skill: one that unlocks many, many other skills. If you can become more effective at taking in body information (of which there is TONS...~1,000,000,000,000,000 brain-stimuli per second to be precise) you have engaged one of the most sophisticated sensory super-systems in the history of the world: the human body.So how do we actually go about getting better at this \"listening\" skill? Step one is to face the fact that it's going to take some focus on the present moment, as in: What is happening. RIGHT. NOW?Ask yourself that question out loud, right now. Let the words hang in the air.Don't be distracted by your phone, or your grocery list, or that voice in your head that doubts every damn thing that you do.Instead notice that your body probably wants to breathe in ... and then breathe out.What do you hear?Smell?How warm or cold are you?Just for a moment, I invite you to escape into your present reality....Now, if you actually played along, you just experienced a little mini-meditation. Notice whatever reactions you have to that word--meditation--and then realize that in this context, it is nothing more than practicing the skill of paying attention to the current moment.Whatever you find here, good or bad, this is always where you start. Because for all its simplicity, the \"right now\" question is one that almost never actually penetrates our consciousness. Too busy are we to stop, like Mr. Ferris Buehler, and actually look around. Fuck that.The more we have the strength to just stand in the stream of our consciousness and watch all the stuff (opinions, judgements, feelings, dreams, nagging worries,etc) float on by, the more skillful we become at tuning in and engaging our magnificent sensory network of nerves and tissues.Then, we just apply that \"right now\" skill to our lives.If we apply it to a movement task, like deadlifting or running (or a million other options), we allow all the incoming sensory information to course through the super-computer in our head. Unimpeded by the slow, conscious, doubting mind, we can execute closer to our fullest potential--much closer. Perhaps more importantly, we get an accurate read on if the movement is safe for our bodies. To quote the bro-tastic Kelly Starret (love the guy): if it feels sketchy, it probably is sketchy.If we apply the \"right now\" skill to a conversation with a colleague or loved one, we actually hear their words before immediately settling on a judgement of those words. We see them laid out in front of us, in a way we can think thoughtfully about (and not just be a reactive jackass... oh, that's just me? I don't think so ... :).And if we apply it to an exercise specifically designed to maximize proprioceptive* information--like CARs**--we systematically increase the functionality of a single body system. Joint by joint, that renewed functionality upgrades our expression of movement. Our body makes better choices. Tune in, level up.And it all starts with paying attention.Tune in (see what I did there?!) next week when I talk about another master-skill, one that is right under our nose, but all-too-often hidden in plain site.-Will*Which google defines as: \"relating to stimuli that are produced and perceived within an organism, especially those connected with the position and movement of the body.\"**to learn more about CARs, check out my previous post on the topic HERE.PPS: If you want a leg-up on your very own CARs practice, you can grab our nifty video by clicking HERE.",

    "Becoming Fluent, part III": {
      "text": "I've been reading this awesome book by Dan Lieberman (he's the Harvard professor/dude who did a lot of the actual research that supports the bare-foot running movement) about how and why the human body evolved the way it did.Again and again, he hammers home the point that the more stressful the environment, the more strongly certain traits were selected for. A basic example: when food is really scarce, the slightly more spring-y foot structure of early upright humans allowed them to be just a little more efficient, to walk and run just a little further, and to be just a little more effective at finding food than their more flat-footed brethren.And that meant that the spring-y-footed humans were slightly better at surviving, reproducing and passing on their cool feet. Which makes all the difference when we're talking about evolution.Now, in this third installment of our series about Becoming Fluent in the language that your body actually speaks (catch the first two HERE and HERE), we AREN'T talking about evolution, exactly (because evolution generally takes tens (or hundreds) of generations, at least*).But we are talking about communicating real information, effectively, to your body. Just like stressful conditions caused humans to evolve more quickly, to change your body, the messages need to be strong enough, clear enough, stressful enough, for the body to actually take notice.If instead of talking about an ecosystem of many plants and animals (like the African jungles and savanna from which we all came...), evolving over hundreds and thousands of years, we can imagine our own bodies as little mini-ecosystems that try to balance out the various stresses that are imposed upon us, we start to get an idea about what effective intervention on our own body really looks like.Most of the time, when we talk to our clients about stress, we start by talking about things like work stress, not sleeping enough, emotional stress, crappy-food stress, all of which are real, stressful inputs on our bodies.And our amazing human organism can do the necessary somersaults and adjustments to withstand quite a bit of that kind of stress ... until it piles up, becomes unmanageable, maybe starts to cause pain. The life stress has gradually moved their body to a place that they don't want to go.That's usually when they come find us :).When those kinds of stresses start to pile up, the first job is always to work to take away some of the stressful inputs (this is when actually tuning in to your own self is critical; think CARs, meditation, etc.).But then, the next step is to add stresses that nudge the body in the direction we do want to go. You can think of these as \"positive stressors\", but make no mistake: they are necessarily pushing our body in a way that is NOT the norm**. They must, otherwise the body has no need to take notice, and change.This is why doing deadlifts with 12 pounds is probably not worth your time. But deadlifts that are sufficiently heavy will make your body perk up, take note, and change to be stronger. BOOM...\"get stronger!\" message = communicated to your body.It's also why in Kinstretch class we ask people to push themselves to create high levels of internal tension as they explore end-range, stretched positions. BOOM...\"get more mobile!\" message = communicated to your body.It's also why things like deep breathing (think controlled hyper-ventillation) and breath holds can actually have an effect on your blood vessels, pulmonary system, cellular energy production, and even immune response (Whhattt?!). More on that next time... :)So! as you head into this weekend I encourage you to think about what kinds of stressors you are applying (...or allowing to be applied...) to your body.Are they helping you go where you want to go?Be well!- Coach Will--*There are some really interesting instances of \"faster\" evolution, but I'm already out of my depth so just read the book if you're curious.**Dosage is really important at this stage: too much too soon can just be too stressful on your body, and cause the opposite of what you want. So listen up to what your body is telling you!!",

    "Hannah's Session with @HunterFitness": {
      "text": "Hey, coach Hannah here, with a little confessional story for ya...I just got back from a weekend in LA. Last November I signed up for an event I knew barely anything about (youve probably heard me talking about the Summit of Power if you follow us on Instragram) but when I signed up, it didnt even have a name yet. This is a different story, for another email.Leading up to the event, I realized that I would be nearby to one of my mobility training mentors, Hunter Cook. I knew I would kick myself if I didnt at least try to get in a training session with him while I was in the area. Amazingly, he had an opening in his crazy schedule, so I fought Friday LA traffic to get all the way down to Long Beach.While we were messaging back and forth before the session, he had asked me to be very clear about what I wanted to address in the session, so that we could jump in and maximize our time together. Heres exactly what I said:I want to work on my shoulders. They are my personal blind spot. I have a good sense of what my hips (and other joints) need and how to go after it, but I am like a clueless 2 yr old throwing a tantrum when it comes to my shoulders. I'd like to get a clear read on what's needed. I'm hoping that will unlock the same creativity I have so readily at hand when solving for my clients issues ;)\"To sum up: Ive always felt like my shoulders were tight and lately Ive been having pain in what used to be my good shoulder. I want to do cool shit like pull-ups and handstands and aerial silks, so I need better range of motion, better control, and no pain.If your irony meter is going off the charts right about now, youre hella tuned in. Yes, this is exactly the same stuff I help my clients with, every day of the week.So why am I still stuck with tight, painful shoulders?Because knowing is not the same as doing.Here's how our session went down:Hunter started by asking me what I had been doing to make my shoulders better. He then asked me to show him my shoulder CARs (which I do daily). He assessed my range of motion, and confirmed just how limited it is. Based on that assessment, and my reported experience, he told me what I need to work on: the deep stuff - the shoulder capsule - not the outer muscles.We then reviewed the techniques that will address and resolve this issue (techniques I learned at the FRC seminar back in April). He did show me a few new/different set ups for those techniques.I posted some of them on Instagram.But here's the crazy thing: he didnt give me a new magical exercise or even a novel idea. He didnt uncover a mysterious underlying cause that I had missed.Hunter didnt tell me anything I didnt already know.The real lesson that seeing him drove home?Knowing is not the same as doing.The body needs regular and consistent stimulus to make a lasting change.Knowing WHAT TO DO to deliver that stimulus wont make your body change.DOING the thing over and over for a sustained period of time willmake the body change.(I just ended three sentences in a row with the word change - and I'm not going to change that.)The moral of this story is:Sometimes you need to pay someone smart to tell you to do shit you know you should be doing.Even if you are a smart person who other people pay to tell them to do shit they know they should be doing.So Im signing off now, to go DO THE THINGS I need to do to make my shoulders better.Thanks for listening,HannahPS. If you are my client and you feel like you have a similar blindspot,book your quarterly private.PPS. If you aren't my client yet,I'm opening up a limited number of slots for 15 min phone calls. If you need to be called out, that's what they are for. Drop me a line if you're interested and I'll let you know when that goes live.",

    "Make Your Mornings Suck Less: Part 4": {
      "text": "Good morning! Coach Hannah here, with your next dose of morning realness.So far we have talked about taking time for yourself first, the transformative power of laughing, and seeing the light with the right alarm clock.if you missed any of the previous emails in this series you can catch up over on our website.Today I want to talk to you about a concept that I call \"Smoothing the Path.\"To be honest, I wasn't aware that I was doing this path-smoothing at first. It was only after reading all y'alls replies to my first email about mornings that I started to really deconstruct what I was doing that made my mornings ok. Sometimes great. But at least ok.Here's what smoothing the path has looked like for me.I know that I am generally grumpy toddler when I wake up. It is often dark, and cold. There are lots of reasons to want to stay in bed, or to resent having to get moving. Especially when you are forced to wake up early. Toddler tantrums are a serious risk here.At night, before bed, I am a grown-ass adult woman, and I have the bandwidth to make some mature and reasonable choices.I have found it useful to leverage this fact to help my morning toddler deal with her shit.Thus, adult Hannah handles the following actions before bed:I lay my clothes out. Not only that, I make sure everything is right side out (no risk of putting that shirt on inside out in the dark) and I place them in piles so that they are available to grab in the order in which they need to be put on my body. Pants, with underpants on top. Sports bra on top of tank top on top of sweater. This may seem excessive, but just wait until morning. It feels so damn good to just EXECUTE. Also toddlers don't do well with decisions.I prep my coffee. Fill the kettle with enough water, make sure the french press is emptied from the day before and ready to go. I make sure the kitchen counter is clear of obstacles - no piled up dishes in front of the coffee making station! Morning toddler Hannah needs only the tiniest of excuses to freak out and ruin the whole day.I set up my lunch in the fridge right at the front, so it's easy to grab.I shower before bed, if showering is needed that day.I pre-fill a glass of water and place it next to my bed.In the morning, all Toddler Hannah has to do is follow the path:Drink waterput on clothesbrush teethgo to kitchenstart the kettlegrind coffee beansdo CARs (while coffee is brewing)meditateput lunch in backpackwalk out the doorBAM!It actually feels good to run through this series most days. Toddler Hannah even appreciates my adult night-before-self and feels deeply cared for--like when your mom leaves you a cute note in your lunch box.The sequence feels like a line of dominoes that are carefully placed by someone else, and in the morning I get to flick the first one over and watch with glee as they all topple. Wooohooooo!Now, I have spent some time fine tuning this process - don't feel like you have to get it perfect the first time around. But start somewhere. You can always revise.Start by thinking through what needs to happen in the morning before you leave the house.How many dominoes are you dealing with (i.e. what are the must-happen items of your morning)?What could you pre-set for yourself?What decisions can you remove?What time do you need to be literally walking out the door?What time do you need to get up? (track backward from here to figure out how much time each \"domino\" on your list will take, and then you'll know what time you need to set your alarm.)Yes, this takes some time the night before.But I would sure rather let adult Hannah handle that ish than hope that groggy toddler Hannah will be able to manage it in the morning. She won't. We know her.Does this make sense? Do you have ideas about how you can smooth your pathin the morning?-HannahPS: One decision you can easily remove is WHAT to do for your morning movement. Our 10 Minutes of Morning Alchemy videois a great way to sneak some mobility into your day, and ground you in your body before you have to take on any of the day's challenges.",

    "Opting Out of \"Thin\"": {
      "text": "For a long time I was running the race to be THIN.(For most of my life, it didn't feel like there was any other choice.)As a woman in America, the cultural narrative is loud and it comes at you from all angles:Thin is healthy.Thin is attractive.Thin is achievable(if you aren't thin, you aren't trying hard enough, and you're probably lazy).Thin is the only worthy goalfor your female body.Thin is measurable(by the number on the scale, by calories in and out, by the size on your clothing tags.)...And you'll never know if you are thin ENOUGH, so keep hustling.And hustle I did.To be honest, I started strength training as part of my pursuit of thin-ness.But luckily there are are some key differences in the pursuit of strength, that helped me widen my perspective.Strong is healthyStrong is attractive Strong is achievable(this is actually true, any body can get stronger, whereas not every body is meant to look like our cultural standard of \"thin\")Strong is also measurable. (By how much weight you lift. By how many reps and sets you do.)But here's my favorite part:Strong is relative.Strong is not one size.Even in weight lifting competitions, your achievements in strength are measured relative to your bodyweight.For example, an impressive Deadlift for women is 1.7x her bodyweight.This shifts the focus away from comparing to others, to comparing you to yourself.Strength training asks us: what can YOU do with what YOU'VE got?Within weightlifting communities, there's an emphasis on celebrating PRs (which stands for Personal Record).Because we are all striving for our own personal best, we get to support each other's wins. We don't ask if they are more or less impressive than anyone else's.We allow ourselves to be inspired by each other's successes, rather than feeling like someone else's accomplishment steals from our own.At our gym there's a PR bell. When you accomplish a feat of strength you've never accomplished before, you get to ring it.When that bell rings, everyone in the gym stops what they are doing and cheers.It's really important to me to hold this space dedicated to personal work. To hold a space free of comparison.A space where we celebrate each other's wins, and acknowledge that success looks different for each individual.Where we encourage each other to pursue what is personally meaningful to each of us.Especially for women.There aren't a lot of spaces like that for us.It's been incredibly healing for me to spend time in such spaces.I've finally opted out of the Pursuit of Thin. I hung up my race number.These days, I'm focusing on what I can do, and how my body feels, rather than what my body looks like or how \"big\"or \"small\"my body is. I no longer weigh myself. I don't even spend much time looking in the mirror.If being thin is important to YOU personally, by all means, pursue it. But check in with yourself, and just ask if thinness is a goal you chose, or if it's a race you opted into by default because it's the cultural norm.Since I opted out of the thin race, I am more motivated to move my body in healthy ways. I am more motivated to eat nourishing foods. And I like myself a whole lot more.My health as a result, has improved. (Healthy is also NOT A SIZE. Healthy is completely relative to the individual - but that's a post for another day.)If you are feeling moved by this email, and you want to start experimenting with moving for YOURSELF and not for a culturally imposed weight loss goal, you'll want to start with Daily CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations).And I'm including a special offer:If you buy the CARs video, do it, and send me your feedback, I'll hook you up with a 20minute coaching call with me.We can talk about whatever you want - what's holding you back, any of the CARs you want to understand in more depth, motivation struggles, your morning routine, you name it. I'm here to help.>>grab the video by clicking HERE.If you already bought the CARS video, the offer still stands! Send me your notes and I'll get back to you to schedule a call.To YOUR resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "This story details the most expensive walk around lake Merritt I've ever taken.(Hannah, here, with the full dish as promised in my #randomtalkingvideo)Every Tuesday morning at 7:10am I meet with a group of professionals who are dedicated to helping each other's businesses grow via referrals.We eat breakfast together, let each other know what type of person would make a good referral for us this week, and thank each other for closed business from the week before.It's a ritual I've come to love.We're a quirky, multi-talented bunch.This week, our health insurance guy gave me a batch of his home-roasted coffee beans. (see, multi-talented!)I put the beans in my backpack and forgot about them.After the meeting, the Realtor In our group and I decided to take a walk around the lake together.I had biked to the meeting that day cuz my car is in the shop, so she generously offered for me to leave my giant, heavy backpack in her trunk while we walked.Now, before you locals say anything, I KNOW that cars get broken into and shit gets stolen on the regular in Oakland.But it was 8:30am. In broad daylight. In a well-traversed area in the parking lot of a fancy restaurant.So I was like, sure!We had a lovely walk and an even better talk.We got back to the car refreshed, basking in the glow of a budding friendship.We hugged each other and turned to open the trunk.It was then that I saw the chunks of broken glass by the rear tire.It was then that she opened the trunk and I saw my backpack was missing.It was then that my heart sank and I wished helplessly for a time machine so I could rewind my life ONE HOUR and not make that choice.My backpack was gone.Laptop - gone. Keys - gone (including my bike lock key, rendering my bike a prisoner of the kryptonite u-lock and me transportation-less.) My checkbook--gone!My mind raced - what else was in my backpack? Anything else crucially important?The rest of the day turned into theft triage.First order of business: cancel those checks and put a freeze on the checking account attached to them.Report my laptop stolen and turn on the tracking of the device. In case it turns up. Ha. Ha. File a police report (which, it turns out, you can do online--too convenient? Maybe. Clearly this happens to a lot of folks in Oakland. Insert me feeing EXTRA DUMB for leaving my valuables in a parked car.Try to find spare key for bike lock.To no avail.Google search: \"how to break a kryptonite u-lock\" to much horror - it's pretty hard to do without a grinder. And even then, pretty dangerous.Cry.Search for bike key again. (No dice)Cry some more.And then my luck turned.The Body shop called to say my car was ready to pick up. Whew! At least I'd have transportation.Then I saw a text from Will saying \"check your email!!!\"A woman named Kay, a property manager for a building near the lake, had emailed to say that her groundskeeper had found my backpack with all of the pockets unzipped but with the keys attached in their parking lot. She had it in her office and I could come pick it up until 5 PM.Luckily, my business cards were in my backpack, which allowed her to contact me.Luckily, she was a kind person who took the time to email me.Thanks to her, I was reunited with my backpack and my keys, and was able to rescue my bike.Amazingly, my checkbook was still in my backpack!The laptop, of course, was long gone.Im composing this email on my phone. (Such is my dedication to you, dear friends.)Also still in the backpack was the bag of home-roasted coffee beans from that morning.So I brewed myself a cup of victory coffee today, to celebrate my good fortune in the midst of bad luck.Its the little things, yall.",

      "text": "Hey team,Happy Thirst-day!I wanted to follow up on the email about my backpack (and laptop) getting stolen a few weeks ago.(Coach Hannah, herecatch up on the whole Saga of the Stolen Backpackif you missed that email.)As I have been telling the story to those closest to me, I've realized there is a key part of it that didnt make it into my email to you.It might be the best part of the whole story.When I was putting my backpack into the back of the car,I had a small feeling in the pit of my stomach.A little whisper.A knawing.It said:dont do this.But I didnt listen to that feeling.Instead I negotiated with myself:Its 8:30 in the morning!Its broad daylight!Youve left your backpack in the trunk in this parking lot at this time of day BEFORE and it was fine!I logic-ed my way out of the FEELING.When we returned to the car and I saw the broken glass on the ground, THAT SAME FEELING RETURNED to the pit of my stomach,but it was magnified 10x.The same-ness of the two feelings, the small feeling before the event and the huge feeling after, said: you KNEW this was going to happen.In the heat of the moment of loss, I felt that knowing very clearly.And I felt a second, very familiar impulse: you knew this was going to happen and you didnt prevent it -you idiotIn the days later, as Ive been telling this story, and swallowing the full reality of losing a brand-new laptop (gulp), and the reality that no, homeowners insurance wont cover it, and yes, your credit card doeshave purchase protection, but only for 90 days and its now day 143 (double gulp)I found a re-frame.Im not an idiot, but I am stubborn, and therefore:This lesson needed to be expensive so that I would LISTEN to that small feeling next time.So Im engaging in a new practice of listening to my gut feeling. And any time I catch myself negotiating, it means I need to take a hard stop, and listen in more closely.Do you trust your gut?Do you catch yourself negotiating with yourself?How do you navigate these things?Im curious :)Yours in reflection,Hannah",

    "Meaningful Measurement": {
      "text": "When your job is to work with humans on their physical bodies--how they move, how they look, how they feel--you are forced to confront a big, murky question:how do you measure change?On the one hand, you have the \"measure-or-die\" camp. This is the view that says that the only way to improve somethingis if you actively and continuously measure it. While there are some major issues with this approach, I do appreciate the perspectivebecause it forces two critical questions to be addressed:WHAT exactly do you actuallycare about changing(enough to want to diligently measure/improve it)? This requires clarity and focus about what you want to work on. General and abstract won't cut it; only specific and defined will do.HOW will you go about changing/measuring that focus?Again, a lot of random workoutideas smushed togetherwon't magically turn into the specific change you want; only focused effort, followed by focused measurement, will allow you to know if your efforts were successful (and the intended change happened) or not (and you should change course moving forward). Anything else is guess-work.There's a particular kind of honesty and humility with dealing in hard-numbers like this.When change doesn't happen as you were planning,you can't do anything but face the facts (NOTE: this may be incredibly painful and/or shame-inducing--nota great outcome; see below), and when itdoesyou know that the change was really real. Either way,numbers don't lie(when measured accurately and consistently).ON THE OTHER HAND... you have the \"don't-measure-anything\" camp. This is theperspective that appreciates thathumans arenotcold, hard facts.We are actuallyhot, seething, irrational animals, who clothe ourselves with cultural norms and technology and--sometimes--cling to the commitment to only believewhat we can measure (see above). As Dre Spina (founder of FRC) says, we're \"apes who want things.\"This is a much more abstract world-view; literally anything goes. But, as anyone who has had prescientgut-instincts about some eventbefore it happened, this is a view that is very real, despiteits resistance to measurement.This perspectivedescribes our emotional world, our spiritual world.Living in these worlds is centralto our experience--and to our success or failure--as humans.In fact, sometimes the mere act of trying to work on a measurable task (\"measure-or-die\") can be overwhelming to the point of distraction; instead of prompting positive change,strictmeasurement can cause intolerable anxiety, and make someone quit (not so positive ).So, when facing the question of whether or not to measure someone's work in the gym, we must content with these two, contradictory world-views...Do we measure doggedly, to \"prove\" that the physical work results, over time, in trackable results?Or do we allow someone's internal environment/experience to take precedence, with all the randomness and uncertainty that goes along with it?We Fitness Alchemists have a simple answer:BOTH.Most of the time, we focus on improving your awareness of that inner world, at least as it relates to your body.What is really going on at your joints? What does tension and relaxation actuallyfeel like?These are questions that will never have a number for an answer, and yet they are incredibly useful to ask, nonetheless.In fact, this improvement in awareness is themain driverfor measurable changethat we see (when we do test), mostly because it allows your brain to make better use of your inherent capability.As James Baldwin wrote, \"Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\"You truly face your body when you do CARs.And then--as we did this week with our in-person clients--wealsowork tocapture actual number-data as it relates to change. Every 8 weeks, we carefully test and assess specific movements that we have focused on, and take accurate note of the results.But perhaps most critically, we allow clients to engage with this \"Testing Week\" as much or as little as isuseful for them.Some people live for Testing Week, and look forward to this opportunity for hard feedback. And some people ignore it completely, because they've realized that focusing too intently on cold, hard facts makes real progress much harder, or even impossible.We can see both sides, because each offers important information. Take what's useful, and drop the rest.Go find your gold,Coach Will",

    "Spaghetti Squash Pizza Pie": {
      "text": "        Photo by PaleoOMG - recipe is a slight adaptation of her brilliant original :)    This is one of my favorite recipes that tastes like comfort food (PIZZA) but is made out of -- you guessed it -- vegetables.This is also a great recipe to make on a Sunday and eat for multiple meals throughout the week, which in my opinion is the best way to handle feeding yourself like a grown-ass human. #fuelyourawesomeIts gluten free (GF), can be Dairy Free, and Paleo (ish). Ingredients1 large spaghetti squash (or two smaller ones)1 pound Italian sausage (skip this if you want to make it vegetarian, or sub chicken sausage if youre not into pork.) yellow onion, diced2 medium sized zucchini, diced1 cup pizza sauce (I like the Trader Joes brand)1 teaspoon dried basil1 tsp dried oreganosalt and pepper, to taste3 eggs, whiskedI cup grated mozzarella cheese (skip this if you dont do dairy -  its great even without cheese!)(optional: add any toppings you like with pizza: mushrooms, olives, basil, goat cheese, pepperoni, etc)DirectionsCook your spaghetti squash. If you have an Instant Pot, do this.  It saves you 20+ minutes. If not, no worries! Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. Place spaghetti squash cut-side down on a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until the skin of the squash gives when you press on it. Then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees.Once squash is done cooking, remove threads and place in an 8x8 greased baking dish.Place a large pan over medium heat. Squeeze the Italian sausage out of its casing. Cook until pink no longer remains in the sausage and it is broken up into pieces. Use a slotted spoon to scoop the sausage pieces into your baking dish.Cook your onions and zucchini in the sausage drippings. If want to add extra veggies, do it now! Throw some sliced mushrooms or chopped green peppers in that pan and cook em up with the sausage yumminess.) This is a good time to make sure you get as much water out of your veggies as possible. Medium high, and stir to separate the veggie pieces so the steam can escape. Dont put a lid on! Season with S&P. Add pizza sauce, dried basil, oregano and salt and pepper to the baking dish and mix well.Add your veggies from the skillet to the baking dish and mix well with spaghetti squash threads.Mix in half of the cheese, save the other half to sprinkle on top. Lastly, add whisked eggs to the baking dish and mix everything together until you can no longer see the eggs.Sprinkle remaining cheese evenly across the top. Place in oven and bake for 1 hour or until the top of the mixture forms a slight crust that doesn't give when you press on it in the middle of the dish.Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.enjoy the taste of pizza, with the smug knowledge that you are eating vegetables like a responsible grown up. Cant wait to hear what topping variations you will come up with. Hit us up in the comments with any questions, or to tell us your favorite topping combos for pizza. ",

    "Where Should I Start?": {
      "text": "OK, heres what I do: I meet someone who wants to change their body, either functionally or aesthetically (actually most often its actuallyacomplex, opaque amalgamation ofthetwo). After determining where they are, physically-speaking, I decide how I can help them go where they want to go, and try to communicate that to them.As such, I spend about half my time understanding where someone is currently--the industry term is assessment--andtheother half thinking about what they can do to change (fit-biz term: intervention).And then we get to work.We talk, we laugh, we move, we cry, we sweat, we think, we make plans, and we abandon them. We shedtheparts that dont serve us, and we hone in onthe stuff that works. Together we are actively creating change, as specific as possible to that person.Thats all.Overtheyears, it slowly dawned on me that perhapsthemost challenging part of this process isasimple misconception:people dont know where theyrestarting from. In fact, most ofthetime they dont care.Sometimes, Id even guess that they actively would like to ignore thatstartingpoint.Its too scaryto see themselves with that sort of accuracy/reality.But this lack of clarity makestheprocess of Change feel--to them--completely disjointed and complex, because they don't have their bearings.On top of that, it also fundamentally changes how I must interact withtheperson. Of course, to coach themIneed to clearly see both sides ofthe\"Change Equation\" (assessment, intervention);but atthesame time I must consider how muchthe person sees, or wants to see, of themselves.Too much realness, too soon, can make us fold.So how quickly and effectively they shiftreally comes down one question:Do they care enough to face up to what their body can do, right now?Yikes--that looks so dramatic when I write it like that. I love me some good drama, but its not very useful for instigating action. Drama isnt very practical.Enter CARs.ControlledArticularRotations. CARs are as practical as it gets inthe fitness world.One ofthefirst things I learned about CARs was that it was, while beingaway of training your joints, it effectively hadaself-assessment systembuilt right in. In fact, this was one ofthemain qualities that differentiatesFunctional Range Conditioning (FRC,thesystem from which CARs originate) from most other movement systems.This changed everything for me (and my students).Because if you can assess yourself well--truly know yourstartingpoint--your whole attitude toward Change asapossibility shifts.It shifts to be more true, more effective, but simpler to conceptualize, too. If you really know where you are (pointA), and you can clearly understand where you want to go (pointB), to improveyou just need todraw straighter and strongerlines fromA toward B.Butthebiggest benefit?Changeshifts into beingajourney that you control, not one that controls you.***These days, when I first work with that new someone, and were discussing howtheexercises I just taught them--CARs--can changethewhole game, I mention this assessment benefit.I mention how, by goingslow and controlled, right attheoutskirts of their range of motion, they candeftly side-step painful areasandmake surethat their CARs are safe. And in doing so they can effectivelysee whats really going on in their body.Almost no one believes me that first dayaboutthepower of CARs. Buttheones who do--who go home and practice their CARs--come back withafamiliar look:relief.Because while going slow, avoiding their painful areas, they actuallysaw themselves. For many, this isasobering moment,aharsh reminder oftherealities of their body. But it's also inherently hopeful.Because itsastartingpoint.Go find your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "Allowing my naturalcurlyhair to be well,curlyhas been a powerfullesson in letting go ofcontrol.Which is NOT my natural impulse.I like things better when they are controllable. Decide-on-able. When each element can be arrangedjust so.This is not possible with naturalcurls.          This mane?She does what she wants. Of course shecanbecontrolled, with a lot of effort. I spent years (hours, lots of kilowatts of electricity, and many bottles of product) smoothing and straightening mycurlsinto a predictable andcontrolledsituation of straight, or at least smooth, hair.But to truly embrace hair with naturallycurlytexture, Ive had to learn how to listen and go with the flow. Ive had to let go of having an agenda, and instead ask her what she is up to, today. Each day is very different. And humidity always adds a curve ball.These daysits more of relationship, between me and the mane.I check out what she is giving me each morning (#morninghair), and then decide how I want to work with her to create a collaborative expression that will suit the activities Ill be involved in that day.Of course I still pull the full parentalcontrolcard sometimes, which these days looks like the ever-debated top knot. Its kind of my way of saying: I cant deal with you today, go to your room!Layer by layer, Im realizing that control is an illusion, in most areas of life.We like to think we cancontrolour bodies.I hear this notion most often with clients who have had chronic pain. Theyve worked out certain positions in which they cansuccessfullynot feel their pain,and mistake that to mean that thepain isgone.(Not the same thing, at all.)Then they blame the painful positions for the pain itself. Sitting is painful or running hurts my knees or as long as I dont slouch and I have good posture, Im fine.The truth is, the healthy human body can and should be pain-free in all positions.No position or movement is inherently bad or good objectively speaking.However, certain movements or positions will hurt a body that is unprepared for those positions or movements.The other thing I hear all the time from my chronic pain clients is that they do a great job of avoiding pain by avoiding positions MOST of the time, but inevitably there will come a moment when their guard is down, and they end up in that position for one reason or another, and then they are back in pain.You see, the avoidance strategy depends on our MINDSpolicing our BODIES24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Thats a tough gig for the ol' noggin. Its a strategy that is doomed to fail SOME of the time.Getting back to the idea of what we can and cantcontrol- we simply cantcontrol for enough variables to ALWAYS avoid that problematic position.What we CANcontrolis how prepared our bodies are (at a cellular level) for any and all stressors, positions, and movements.We have to opportunity to systematically improve the resilience of our bodies - joints, muscles, ligaments, organs, skin - such that we have leeway to withstand those positions that used to be problematic for us.Another way to think of it:We have very limited ability tocontrolour EXTERNAL environment**We have 100% access tocontrolour INTERNAL environmentGiven those odds, where is your energy most efficiently spent?**It's worth acknowledging that in this day and age, we do have more ability than ever before in human history tocontrolour external environment. We have houses with fine-tuned heating and cooling. We can cushion ourselves with pillows and mattresses. We can support ourselves externally with ergonomic chairs, keyboard wrist pillows, insoles and orthotics, knee braces and back braces, and the list goes on.And yet, pain persists.The first step oncontrollingyour internal environment is to develop a relationship with yourself.Spend some time each day, checking in on all the movement options you have that are pain free. Get to know where those limits are. At first, just make non-judgemental notes. Then, with guidance, get after expanding those limitations one by one, until you have complete physical freedom.This is my desire for all humans. That we can know ourselves, trust ourselves, and grow into our fullest potential.A great place to start is with 10 mins per day ofCARs, and 10 mins per day of simple meditation (just being aware of your thoughts, your self.)In this way, just like I did with mycurlyhair,you can begin to cultivate a relationship with yourself and your body, where you work together collaboratively, to show up in all your glory.Sotake some time to be quiet &alone, and to move mindfully, and see what happens.To your ongoing alchemy,Hannah",

      "text": "I start my days early. And not because Im a morning person. (Coach Will checking in )I pull myself out of bed, slip on sweats, and stumble in front of the little space heater in the office of my apartment. Yawning, bleary-eyed in the artificial overhead light, I take a sip of water and settle onto a purple cushion that my love gave me. I start breathing as deeply as I can, pulling in enough air to stretch the sides and back of my ribs. The quick rush of oxygen usually makes my fingers tingle; I imagine the lights being switched on in each of my cells.After thirty (or so) breaths--I can never count clearly--I hold. I just stop breathing. I feel my hands on my lap. I listen to my heart beat. I watch my eyelids.After a few rounds of heavy breathing, I am ready: I start meditating. My breath is now smooth, unhurried. With as little effort as possible, I become aware of everything in my field of consciousness. All the sensations and thoughts and sounds. I just notice them, and then notice as they slip away. And in those moments of early morning stillness, void of breath and to-do lists, I find space, which is what Im after. With space, I have room to maneuver, to consider, to explore, and to not do a damn thing. I have space to be myself. And much like physical space, inner space--the expanse of our minds--takes a conscious clearing to be maintained. In a very real sense, space is a rare thing in our universe: atoms are compelled to fill available space, merely because of the rules of dispersion and entropy. The incessant energetic vibration of all things means that open space doesnt exist for very long before it is filled. This physical reality, which is such a central focus in mobility training (joint space is the prerequisite for healthy joints), is a characteristic of our minds as well. Except instead of vibrating atoms rushing in, we have thoughts, emotions and sensations ricocheting around our consciousness, clogging the potential space of our inner world. But recently, through the work of meditating, I came to realize that the space I was after, that made me feel on firm ground before I waded out into the chaos of life, was just that: a feeling of my conscious mind, and specifically a feeling of being unencumbered. Further, and critically, I realized that such a feeling was not actually a void of activity, but was made possible by the shifting of processes (like breathing and heart-beating, but so much more, too) to my unconscious. The unconscious brain is a fantastic thing, with much more capacity than the conscious brain. We rely on the automaticity of this unconscious for countless daily mental acrobatics (like driving, reading strangers, understanding language, intuition, etc), and accomplish these tasks much more quickly and efficiently than a computer might. Which is all to say: the universe of our minds--with more than 100,000,000,000,000 connections--is mostly made up of processes of which we are unaware. Imagine an iceberg 50 stories tall, with just a few feet protruding out of the waves. Our unconscious is all of the ice under the water. To me, that is a reassuring (conscious) thought. Suddenly, the space I work to feel in my conscious mind isnt actually a refuge at all, but a vista from which I might witness the operational majesty that is the unconscious brain. Put another way: the feeling of lacking space, of being closed in by thoughts of worry, anxiety, distraction--all events in the conscious mind--is really just a function of how limited the conscious mind actually is. It is the seal sitting atop the iceberg, who hasnt yet realized that they can swim.But of course, we can swim. By clearing the space of our conscious mind, we can become aware of the incredible agility of rest of our minds, and direct that power. To your gold, Coach Will",

      "text": "An image from Sam Harris (hes got an excellent guided meditation app that has been a big help for me) has been stuck in my thinking recently: most of us, most of the time, are just flailing around in the windstorm of our thoughts. Pulled every which way, with no real rhyme or reason, we can often feel utterly out of control, even when were trying really hard to be in control. I know this feeling well. That particular brain-pinch when I imagine that through the power of my own willful thoughts I will somehow change my reality. The utterly egotistical stance that somehow my thinky-thinky will take charge and fix it all.Of course, the notion is false, and I have plenty of evidence that shows me that it is. Standing on stage, hearing a wrong note come from my trumpet bell, and thinking about how to fix it (even though its in the past)Setting up for a deadlift, and thinking that I can ensure perfect form (which really, is not even a possibility). Deep in conversation, and thinking about how to persuade or convince the person Im talking to (which makes it more of an argument than a conversation anyway).Looking at my bank account, and thinking about how to save more (If I just). In each scenario, the active thinking part of my brain that I identify so strongly with--it really feels like me--ramps up. Seeking control, it jumps in heroically to fix the situation. And what starts as one little thread of a thought spawns another, and another, and another Pretty soon its a windstorm up in here, and Im lost.Which begs a question: whats the alternative? How do I make changes to my reality, without spinning out of control whenever I try to do it? The answer, as I have come to realize for myself, lies in understanding the distinction between my states and my traits. States, specifically mental states, capture your current experience. How do you feel, in this moment? Whats happening in your head, right now? What feel like your needs and wants, aversions and obstacles, this very second?Traits describe bigger-picture truths: who are you, most of the time? How do you feel, most of the time? What do you do with your time, most of the time? Explored with some remove, traits clearly describe the parts of reality that we want to change. Getting stronger, being a better listener, performing better (in any realm) all point to trait-change: a slow, progressive shift in who you are.In comparison, it seems obvious that what we feel moment by moment (our states) really shouldnt dictate the kinds of changes we want to make. Its just common sense that the random windstorm (shitstorm?) inside our heads shouldnt be the decider of our life trajectory, right?And yet, so often, it is. The sensations of our consciousness--the thoughts, feelings, smells, emotions, sounds, etc--are so overwhelming, so real, that they demand priority. They rip us from any foundation or principle that we may have chosen and direct us toward the whim of the moment. And they push us to do anything we can to alter our state. They push us to say something we dont mean, but feels good flying out of our mouths. They push us to drink, and smoke, and eat to excess; to change our inner chemistry in some enjoyable way. They push us to stay glued to the slow-drip media IV that is streaming TV, because its easier than anything else we can think of. At the end of the day, these fleeting mental states and our efforts at short-term distraction from the less-than-pleasant ones distill down to not much more than a cycle. A cycle that, over time, becomes part of who you are: a trait. Altering those traits, on the other hand, is a different game. A longer game, and one that must be able to weather the storm in our heads. More on that next week. Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend! Go find your gold-Coach Will ",

      "text": "You ever stop to think about how much  information there is in the world? (Coach Will here)Even before the internet, the vast billions of humans who came before us thought and wrote and argued over every little scrap (and the big stuff too :). But now, with the perverse combination of absolute frictionless connection (world wide web) and the promise of viral content (pushing more of us than ever to create ever more), we are drowning in the stuff. More opinions, more blogs, more social media posts, and--yes--more newsletters, than any of us could ever read in 10 lifetimes. In this world, recognizing what is good and useful  is far more important than just acquiring as much as possible (a difficult veer away from how our minds generally operate). From all the vast data out there in the information multi-verse, there must be some useful answers to the questions that persist for each of us; but how will we know when we find them? Im not sure, honestly. Its not like theres someone or something that will helpfully ring a bell when we find the right way. But just as worrisome as not finding answers is giving up on searching for them. Heavy stuff. Last week, in exploring the duality of States and Traits, I left out any discussion of what you should do to make a change. Beyond just hating that word (should), Im not satisfied with just feeling bummed out by intractable questions. At bottom, when faced with complex issues, we must at least honor our desire to make a positive change, to alter our Traits. So, where do we go? Or, phrased differently, what tools do we have? Well...We can work on our ability to perceive. Our brains are shaped by incoming information, so a shift in how clearly that information can be picked up makes a big difference in our ability to be effective. Think: meditation, CARs, honest conversations with good friends, etc.We can reflect--truly engage with--our experience. How did an idea play out for us, in our actual lives? (Honesty is everything here, too)We can recognize similarities across realms, and identify certain universals. When an idea keeps popping up, maybe its worth more exploration. Armed with these simple algorithms, we have a shot at seeing the important stuff emerge from the chaos. We have a chance of identifying our values.Heres one of my values, an answer for me, a personal gem that has slowly come into focus over the past few years, even amidst the glut of information, and seems to apply broadly across my life. Maybe it will resonate with you:Put good stuff in, Let it rot, See what happens.I know what youre saying...what?! Hahah. Lemme break it down: in any change process, there will be (a.) what you start with, (b.) a shift governed by laws that are not always obvious (and sometimes seem downright magical), and (c.) where you end up. This little formulation just simplifies it: Care about where you start enough to put good stuff in; be ready for a change-process that you might not recognize, be familiar with, or even like (let it rot); and take the time afterward to reflect--honestly--on how that change-process actually changed things (see what happens). I trust this because of the work I have invested in my ability to perceive the world, and the time I have taken (and continue to take--its not always easy to make this time) to reflect. But mostly, I cant deny the universality of this little three-part Haiku wannabe.It describes my compost, my relationships, my art, my body, my business, my coaching, and much more. And, as a value of mine, it will help shape my future. This weekend, adrift in your own sea of information, I encourage you to think about this little formula, and see where you recognize it in your life. You may be surprised by how it fits, or you might just cast it back, and keep searching. Either way, cheers to finding your goldCoach Will",

    "Food Feels": {
      "text": "Guys. Im sitting here, writing to you, with a gut-ache because I ate garbage oil in two forms - Potato chips & chicken salad. (A sluggish Coach Hannah, here, sharing some post-lunch feels.)This used to be a regular lunch for me - probably close to once a week. I have since learned a lot more about nutrition and how certain foods affect my particular system (which is the most useful type of nutrition knowledge there is IMHO). This is a rant for another day - but in short: Your subjective experience of how a food object affects you is way more useful than facts about how healthy/nutritious/harmful that food objectively is. Provided you are being holistically honest with yourself. The Facts are changing all the time anyway - remember when fat was evil and whole grains were the holy grail? Now everyone is jumping on the Keto bandwagon and eating fat-a-plenty and painting carbs as the villain. These food facts are a shifting landscape. However, how your body reacts in the hour after eating something, in the days after, and week over week, month over month? Now those are data points you can use to take action and steer your course towards where you want to be, and how you want to feel. So why, even though I know canola oil makes me feel like crap, did I dive face-first into a crunchy and creamy festival of the stuff?In asking myself this question, I realized we should talk about it. So Im going to unpack my thought process in real time. Impulse #1: blame the situation. I was reeeeeeally hungry, and the store was out of my first choice chips (cooked with coconut oil which doesnt make me feel like yuck) but I was set on the taste-experience I wanted to have, so I bought the canola oil chips. Its the stores fault. They didnt have the right stuff. Impulse #2: Shame shut-down. Feel gut-ache, feel guilty, decide Im an unreliable caretaker of myself, move further away from self-responsibility and therefore any hope of change!Impulse #3: zoom out, and observe. Notice sensations (belly bloated and brain slow). Notice thoughts (see impulse #1 & #2). Check in with my values: I want to feel present, focused, and energized so that I can do the work that is meaningful to me. In order to reach that state, I need to eat foods that agree with my body. I didnt do that today, and thats ok. Instead Im having an experiential reminder of why I (mostly) dont eat canola oil. When I take this wide-angle view, Im able to strip away moral value from the incident, and it can just serve as an experience of contrast. This is how I dont want to feel! It doesnt have to mean anything about me. But I can allow it to be motivation to change my actions going forward. Or not. This is the choice we all have. Notice (or dont). Adjust based on what you notice (or dont). Rinse, repeat.Especially when it comes to food, there are SO MANY voices competing for our attention. I invite you to join me in tuning in to your inner voice by taking that wide-angle view. Start with these questions: How do I want to feel?How did that food choice make me feel?What can I do differently next time?You wont be perfect all the time  Im a case in point today! But this framework of making choices based on how you want to feel can quickly become a self-rewarding cycle. When I eat things that make me feel good (according to my values: present, focused, energized), I am immediately rewarded with those exact qualities. It makes me want to do more of whats working, and less of whats not. Heres to zooming out & tuning in,Hannah",

      "text": "I (Coach Will) spent my senior year of high school in the woods of northern Michigan. Coming from the beachy, year-round vacation lifestyle that is Southern California, the harsh reality of seasons nearly knocked me on my ass that year. Id been cold before, but losing sensation in my gloved fingers in the 5-minute walk from the dining hall to the rehearsal shed? Puhhleaaase. The student body was a high-strung bunch to begin with (it was an arts high school after-all...think FAME, but surrounded by lakes and trees), but the overwhelming winter, unwieldy teenage hormones, and prodigious amounts of artistic talent-potential (and therefore, expectation) warped us into a seething mass of odd-balls. No parents, no place to go off-campus, no parties, no avoiding anyone (there were only 500 students total across the 4 grades). It was a place designed to help young adults focus their efforts as completely as possible on the pursuit of their art. And sap their sanity. By February, we were white-knuckling our coping mechanisms like life-rafts. We couldnt even comprehend anything beyond our own, personal survival (as I said--we were a dramatic group of adolescents). We binged Netflix, and started gossipy rumors. We had stupid arguments with our roommates, about soy milk and gangster rap. We fell (face-down) in love, and broke each others hearts. We felt insomnia as the crushing malady that it can become. We looked ahead to our futures with desperation, seeking relief and deliverance. And then the sun came out. First, in just glimpses, in March. The clouds would part, and the remaining snow would glint, and for a moment I could remember what solar heat meant. Then, in April, the tiny buds on the trees would beckon us outside on Saturday afternoons to begin testing the ground for dry spots where we might lay down, heads on each others bellies, close our eyes and let the spring wash our souls. By May, the tortures of winter were nearly forgotten. The sheer magnificence of burgeoning green, crammed into every corner of the horizon, settled us, softened us, and reminded us how good things could be. It was a day in May when my friend, sensing some of that old winter desperation in me (to finish a final paper), grabbed my shoulders and said: Will. Sometimes, you need to move at the speed of plants. He was right. As we walked outside, those plants rewarded my deep breaths with smells of richness and renewal. My eyes rested in the leaf-filtered light from young trees and their much older siblings.And I was able to see myself as part of the world, and not the center of it. Plants offered a way for me to see life as larger than myself, both more delicate and more powerful. I would do well to learn from the way that plants survived and bloomed at their own, unhurried pace, without concern for what they should or shouldnt do. Each spring, I remember my friends reminder. I think back to that frantic, delusional winter, and the relief that spring offered. And as I sow seeds in my small raised beds this year, I cheer all the varied life-forms (plants, people, and all the rest) that are using the sun and making a statement. Happy Spring!- Coach Will",

    "practice makes perfect or perfect breaks practice?": {
      "text": "One of my private clients recently hit a 4-day streak with her daily Kinstretch practice -- a goal we have been working towards for the past 2 years. (A proud coach Hannah, here.)While asking her what she noticed during this streak, some very key insights came to light, and Id like to share those with yall.The first thing she noticed was that her former mindset had been holding her back. I kept thinking that if I did my movement practice perfectly, I would become fit and strong IMMEDIATELY! But then it also gave me an excuse to do nothing if I felt I couldnt do a perfect session.Ah, the perfectionist trap! Ready to foil us every time. But this time, it didnt foil her. She got down on the floor and did Kinstretch 4 days in a row. She admitted that each session was far from perfect -- she didnt do all of the sets and reps each time. She didnt push for as much intensity as she does in our sessions together. But every day she did SOME amount of Kinstretch practice. WIN!Even amidst a daily success streak, with momentum underneath her, she noticed that the resistance was right there too: There was this excuse-making engine that I became keenly aware of, tempting her to do it later or just get this one other thing done first. Will that ever go away? she asked, somewhat exasperated. It might not. I replied. It might fade away one day, or it might always be with you. As long as you get the thing done, youve won! And the more practice you get working with those excuses and finding a way to do your practice anyway, the easier it will get.We all know those voices, right? I certainly do. Even as a fitness coach, when I get ready to exercise there is often a voice that pipes up and says put other things first! The excuse-making engine might always be there -- but it doesnt have to mean anything about YOU. That week she had also had the opportunity to go on some vigorous hikes while travelling, and she noticed some major changes in the way her body handled that physical task: Better balance - fewer stumbles on the uneven terrain, less fear of fallingMore stamina - she surprised herself by hiking longer than she thought she would have been able toNo back pain - which used to be a guaranteed outcome of hiking in the pastLo and behold, even though her Kinstretch practice has been far from perfect over the past 2 years that we have been working together, her body is adapting in meaningful ways. Im glad, as her coach, that she got the real-world feedback that her practice is working. Its so helpful to see that our efforts are paying off. Its so easy to discount our efforts, especially when they dont match up to our perfect plan, and give up on the whole quest all together. Her outlook now? Im not doing something because Im expecting a radical change. Im doing a thing because the thing is worth doing. To which I say, A-MEN + Halellooooo!We tend to OVERESTIMATE what we can get done in the short term and UNDERESTIMATE what we can get done in the long term. My clients story is a perfect example of this. She initially imagined that if she did perfect heroic workouts, she would be super-hero fit in 12 weeks. Naturally, that didnt happen. BECAUSE A) THATS NOT HOW THE BODY WORKS, YALL and b) life is always happening all around us, so even the best laid exercise plans always take a hit!She hasnt had a perfect practice. But, when we zoom out and look at the long term, she has been consistent. Over the past 2 years, she has stayed committed to working on her mobility and fitness. Yes, in fits and starts. Yes, some weeks she is more on top of it than others, but never the less, she has stayed the course. And her body is rewarding her with noticeable signs of improved resiliency. Guess what? Your muscles and your joints dont care if your practice is perfect. They crave nutritious movement and will make do with whatever scraps you give them. Its ok to start small. Its ok to do less than you planned. But keep doing something. And, please, for your sanity, keep track! Over the longer haul, youll start to notice your imperfect work paying off, if you pay close attention. To doing the damn thing,Hannah",

      "text": "At times, we all get laid out by life.Coach Will here. I lost a close family friend recently, and the experience punched me. It reminded me of one of lifes non-negotiables.At one point or another, again and again, life will serve us up a healthy plate of crap, of unfair, of what-the-fck. Its part of the cycle of things, but the loss still causes pain; occasionally, the forest burns.It hurts like hell. It leaves coarse scars on our psyche, and can torture us by following even into our dreams and our big decisions (not to mention our relationships and our health). And... like any other natural process, the occurrence of trauma is just a single component of the slow, flowing rhythm of getting hurt and healing.These moments can strike when theyre least expected, but also when they are. And they actually hurt, like sickness or violence, even as they lurk in our thoughts.They impact what we feel in our bodies, and how we feel about the world. They shape our attention, and can define our lives.Flipping through YouTube recently (Im not proud...but always interesting to see what the Algorithm thinks I like :), I came across David Brooks talking about his new book, the Second Mountain.In the interview, he recounts his recent social isolation, divorce, and disorientation as a conservative in the Trump era, and how his struggles led him to look for the kind of people in society who seem to have mastered the overcoming of pain.In each instance, he recognized how they universally turned toward their community, and became weavers of essential social fabric that has been so completely shredded in recent years (according to Brooks).In these moments of loss, Brooks weavers faced the crossroads of becoming Broken (turning toward fear, and further isolation), or of Breaking Open (and vulnerably, deliberately living with those around you).The distinction struck me.Of course, I think about stress all the time.In the gym, stress (in the right amounts) builds us up, makes us stronger and more mobile--so I fully support it. But in regular life, stress (in constant amounts) dulls recovery and gradually breaks us down--so I adamantly preach against it.But now, when we talk about the biggest stressors of life--the traumatic ones--it seems theres no argument: when pain happens (and it always will)--when you crack--you either resist vulnerability, or you become vulnerable.Youre either Broken, or Broken Open.The distinction can make all the difference, but its not an easy shift to see in the moment. In the depths of suffering, up is down, and down is sideways; the choice to move forward, step-by-step, can feel delusional.But sharing what youre going through with those you are close to means that others can know, and share the burden of, what youre feeling. In this way, the community we weave is the basket that holds us together.However you may have been broken--and we all have been at one time or another--Im thinking about you now, as I write this.Im wishing you more joy, and less suffering.Have a golden week- Coach Will",

    "Panning for Gratitude": {
      "text": "Like many of us, my greatest strength is also a pain-in-the-ass weakness. (Coach Will here.)I tend to over-extrapolate.Over-generalize. Over-connect. Try to draw big lessons from minor blips. Also: look for a meaningful signal amidst all the noise.When its acting as a strength, this tendency helps me see the forest made up of so many trees. It helps me hypothesize about causes, so I might test them out, and it generates intentional strategies that guide my action. I see the chess-board 5 moves ahead.But as a weakness, this kind of connection/implication overdrive has me drawing conclusions from nothing, really. A small comment or minor observation will convince me of things that, no matter how exciting or important-feeling, are just not true.I get so excited--so enthusiastic--to connect ideas and meanings that I readily suspend my disbelief and build all kinds of phantasmagorical notions. When it works, I can see what is not obvious; but when it doesnt, I find myself a mile down a road that doesnt matter, going nowhere.This dynamic is part of me, the good and the bad. For every chess trophy it helped me win as a kid, it has kept me up a dozen sleepless night, spinning insomniac anxiety-fantasies in my head.But only recently have I begun to see the real issue with this powerful skill: having this kind of lens on the world ignores so much.Continuously zooming out means that I miss some important details, even as I get hung up on meaningless ones. And no matter how effective I get at discerning the difference, jumping from conclusion to conclusion denies maybe the best part of life: feeling grateful.Which leads me to realize  When Im struggling, gratitude is often the answer for me.And only recently have I realized that true gratitude is a vulnerable feeling for me, because it means returning to a mind-set from childhood: unadulterated joy, that spontaneous, creative and not-intended-to-be-shared gladness for life.Its an inside feeling, an intimate feeling. And one that changes when it is for others.Its a feeling that has you seeing the world with caring detail, and being generous with your attention to whats really going on. In these moments Im reminded, with relief, that Right now is enough.Ahh, sigh.Long, steady exercise puts me right there.          Which is how I found myself half-way up Mt. Tam last month, astride my bicycle, laughing at how outrageous the tiny wild-flowers were, growing right out the side of the rock face, shaking furiously in the wind and telling the fog to f*ck off with their bright whites and purples and yellows.A voice inside shouted: Will, wait! Capture this moment! Share with all the people who might need a reminder of beauty in the world!This voice came from the zoom-out instinct. The Extrapolator. Tie in everything with everything!But then another voice answered: Right now is enough. Take it in, fully. Make a memory. Cherish it. Let it make your life a little better. Share if you care to, later.And before I knew it, I was 100 feet up the road, too slow with my camera but steady with my gaze.Grateful for sweat and redwoods, water and almonds, for the biting cold and the blue sky peaking just over the ridge.This is how Im untying my own knots, these days. How Im doing my work.Because amidst all the stress and strain, whatever that looks like for each of us, there are corners in our lives where the magic-dust collects. It hides in the crevices, in the nooks where we dont think to look.We must pan for that gold.Have a great week!         -  Coach Will",

      "text": "We are about to head to the 2nd Annual FRS Summit this weekend. Will and I really really love getting to nerd out at a weekend seminar, Ill tell you what. (Coach Hannah, here -- heyyyyy!)Last year the theme was Advanced Rotational Training -- aka CARs on steroids. The lectures pulled in space-time theory (you know, just a casual reference to Einstein and Hawking at the bottom of the slides). It was a deep dive into the inner workings of the human body, but the profound truth at the center of it all is this nugget:A joint (be it a hip, shoulder, knee, etc) is the SPACE between bones. In order for that joint to have healthy function and propel you through the world, it first needs adequate work space. Under the constant pressure of gravity, your body instinctually navigates the most efficient way to accomplish any physical task you ask of it. Over time, the space in our joints can start to compress. We start to take up less space, internally, based on the movement paths we tread. If we then decide we want MORE for ourselvesmore strength, more dancing, more energymore than our usual daily actions......Job one is to learn how to create more space for yourself. Take joining a gym or fitness program. When a new client signs up with us, the first job that person has to do in order to actually engage with our training is to figure out where in their week they can fit in three 55 minute sessions. Once the client carves out that space, we can take care of filling it with nutritious movement snacks, but we cant do the job of making the space. The work space has to be created first. Its sounds simple, but it is harder than it seems.Im betting that you, like most of my clients, have a number of priorities competing for your time. Given that reality, making space for a workout can feel like taking space away from something else. It could mean getting up earlier than you usually do, which could mean going to bed earlier than you usually do, which might mean less time with your significant other at the end of the day. Or you decide to just to just short yourself on sleep. EIther way, that space has to come from somewhere. Making space for yourself is the step that often gets skipped - hence why so many people sign up for a gym and never actually get in the habit of going. Or buy an online course but never open it (Im guilty of this one!) So Im just writing you this little love note to say, I hope you can make some space for yourself.If you are trying, and finding it challenging, know that the struggle is REAL. Drop me a line and let me know how you are doing with this concept? Id love to have something to read and respond to on the flight to SoCal this afternoon ;)Thanks for making the space to read my ramblings,Hannah",

      "text": "Coach Will here to say: I have absolutely no problem with making up new words. No matter how ridiculous or nonsensical, the only criteria I maintain is that the listener must understand the word in context. If they do, youre good to go. (...and occasionally they look at you like youre stoned--be warned).In fact, the process of making up shared words is that you create a little bridge of understanding around a specific, new thing.Thats exactly the kind of scaffolding that helps our brains form new memories, even while it releases a nice little hit of feel-good brain chemicals. It feels good to connect.These are the simple, day-in/out interactions that effectively construct that magical thing called community.In our business, our effectiveness at building these emotional interactions is directly reflected with concrete numbers--hard evidence--likeMore regular attendance in classImproved performance on specific training metricsLess injuries*...and a bunch of soft evidence too, like the way someone seems more at ease, more settled, more able to be whoever they are when theyre not stressed-the-fck-out-all-the-time.I was reminded of this recently. After my initial consult call with a new client (F), I found myself re-organizing our usual introductory assessment and session plan to better suit him.I realized how individualizing a program is as much about actually interacting with clients, asking questions and listening deeply, as it is about adjusting what you have them do, especially at first (of course, they do all the real work...).As a coach, taking the time to listen to people, to make as strong a connection with the person in front of you as you can, is so valuable, for so many reasons, that theres no real reason not to. You gotta do it.And we all know what the alternative looks like. Call it mansplaining or being an a**hole, but the temptation for many of us (and lets be honest, especially men) to react as quickly as possible to solve the fcking problem just, well doesnt help that much.Even as I made our intro material more specific to F, I shaped into a form that he would understand better, and not just giving him what we give everyone. Cuz hes not everyone. And I found myself using a new word: variousness...as in, what your joints need to effectively out-maneuver injurious positions. Usually we use the awesome word Variability, which is the technical term for this quality that is magic for joint mobility.Its all about building flexibility, and not necessarily in terms of how far you can stretch (your Range of Motion). Nope, its actually way more important than that.Its about the flexibility of your approach, how ready you are for the next, unknown thing. So when your joints have a whole menu of various movement options--and not just one, overused path--they can spread the load more evenly.Theyre more variable. And armed with that variability, your body can learn how to do some truly amazing things.          But it starts with building the bridge of shared language, understanding, and trust, so that were ready to learn from our environment and each other.Go make up some new words ;),Coach Will",

    "Inside My DNA": {
      "text": "Coach Will here, welcoming you to your Wednesday!And I need to talk about why movement, fitness, (cue the voice of your worst PE coach memory) exercise is--after all is said and done--pure magic to me.See, with the movement-DNA link recently in the news again, I found myself navel-gazing again. That DNA is incredible innit*? Basically a tiny folded up building manual for your whole being, reproduced (almost) perfectly in every single one of your cells. For your whole life.Look at your arm for a moment. Notice the layers apparent to you. See your arm hair, and how it rises out of your skin. Notice any visible freckles, or spots, or veins. And realize that beyond what you can see, you can feel much more--heat, pressure, stiffness, ache, firmness/softness of the various tissue. But now squeeze your fist. Notice how the tissue jolts into incredible, controlled action. Bones remain sturdy while layers of muscle and sinew slide seamlessly along each other, stretching skin in barely-detectable spirals of tension. From a single, simple thought (squeeze fist), a coherent response (movement) seems to spontaneously emerge. That dense tangle of tissue, so coherently but unconsciously organized, was written by our DNA. But theres more. Like the NYTimes reported--but many others (actual coaches/teachers) have been talking about for a long time**--the intent to move, and therefore our reliance on movement, are also written into our DNA. Finally, combine this with the old, trusty standby of any strength coach worth their iron--the SAID principle (which says that a Specific Adaptation is the result of the specific Imposed Demand--SAID)--and you have a breathtaking feedback loop. An organic algorithm. The combination of (1.) resilient, change-able tissue, (2.) a drive to move that tissue, and (3.) an observed principle that describes how movement changes that tissue creates a poised and balanced system: our body. So the DNA recipe said something like this: Produce cells. Organize according to some basic rules. Start moving. And thats all, because the recipe could then assume that the moving does the magic of form-fitting us to our lives. Movement literally forms tissue into a specific use-purpose, based on the specific demands of that movement. After all, Force is the language of our cells.***But without movement, we are left with a bunch of tissue that is missing some major guidance as to what it should become. Sure, elbow tissue is the stuff that grows from your elbow; but it only know how to be a part of your arm (and your life) if you teach it, inform it, apply force through it, which is all just to say: use it. So look at your arm again. Look at it with an internal lens, combining your visual, sensational, and imaginary capacities to form a mental model of all the layers, and all the dimensions of scale (muscle, fiber, cell, nucleus, proteins, atoms). Observe your DNA. And realize that you can, and do, talk to it the very moment you begin to move.What do you want to say?To your gold,Coach Will*Also, an incredible, powerful piece of pop-artwork**Dre Spina (FRC), Katy Bowman (Move Your DNA), Kathy Sierra (Intrinzen), Dan John, Paval Tsatsouline (StrongFirst), and a million more etc. etc.***MORE Dre Spina :).",

      "text": "We make one--and only one--assumption regarding the people who work with us: you want a functioning body.A body that functions. That works. For you.For something to be functional, we neednt overthink anything. A functional body just means that it is:Free of painAble to be moved in a controlled wayThats all.What you choose to do with that functioning body is fully up to you; we dont presume to tell you what that should be (although we have ideas :).No, we only assume that you want a physical vehicle that doesnt hurt, and goes when you say Go.And Go might mean hiking Mt. Whitney, PRing a triathlon, or picking up 400 pounds off the ground (and living to tell the tale!).Or, Go might mean: helping a friend up the stairs, finally feeling a little less daily ache and pain, unloading all the groceries yourself... or any other small but profound shift in life-quality.Or, instead it might mean that when you go road-tripping with your estranged mother, your first contact in 15 years, your chronically painful back actually doesnt fall apart this time. Phew.These, and many other actual client success stories, each a specific and beautiful reflection of what our human organism is capable of, shows us what happens when everything in our bodies works together as a complex, dynamic system. A symphony of a 37.2 trillion cells.But how do you go about actually improving, tuning up, or maintaining such a complex system?In a network this big, to actually direct change and rise above the noise of all the parts requires clear, consistent signals to be sent directly to the parts of your body most adept at listening for signals.And a thorough review of the scientific literature gives us a clear answer where that place is: your joints.Healthy joints are not only the kinetic (moving) corners of our bodies, but also critical information-gathering nodes. Especially packed with special cells called mechano-receptors, your joints relay a constant stream of mechanical information--assuming mechanical information is coming in--to surrounding cells and your brain.From this stream of information comes both physical adaptations (aka tissue changes) as well as an invaluable map in your brain with which you will navigate through all the various obstacles, activities, and challenges of your physical life.So--by assuming that you want a functional body, we can assume that youd like functional joints. Which, as you already know, means joints that are:Free of painAble to be moved in a controlled wayNow, as coaches, we are not qualified to provide pain-relieving care (thats the medical realm of doctors, physical therapists, etc). But it turns out that through the lens of function, being free of pain is actually an incredibly low standard; its obviously a critical, preliminary component, but a joint that is simply pain-free is quite a ways from being actually useful to you.So its the second component--able to be moved in a controlled way--that both demands much more focus and offers a far greater reward.That reward might mean you can experience sustained periods of pain-free movement (something you dont know you crave until youve experienced chronic pain).That reward might mean you experience a sense of physical agency, of confidence in your physical self, that is new for you.That reward might look like achievement of physical accomplishments, athletic pursuits, or other significant physical changes.But doing any of that starts with actually having functional joints.Thats where we come in--more on that next week.Stay tunedCoach Will",

      "text": "Morning! Coach Will here .Last week I wrote about the importance of having functional joints. If you missed it, click here to read it over--I think its about as clear as Ive ever been able to describe it. You should read this email too--all the way to the end theres an announcement of sorts :). Anyway, getting back to having functional jointsUnfortunately for us, modern life has stacked a few imposing obstacles in our path toward achieving this simple yet worthy goal (i.e. joints that  work). First, a lack-of-movement pandemic has quite suddenly (in the grand scheme of time) taken hold of huge number of us humans. Our lives, centered around a healthy baseline of physical activity (aka mechanical inputs) even just 50-100 years ago, increasingly demand nothing more physical from us than staring at a screen, typing on a keyboard, and pushing down a gas pedal. This means that all of our joints are literally starved of the mechanical inputs so necessary for normal tissue regulation and maintenance, not to mention building that invaluable brain-map that we will call on when we do start moving. Which brings us to a second major obstacle: the movement options (workouts) that the fitness industry currently provides as stand-ins for these necessary inputs are usually not suited for the development of functional joints. In the best cases, these workouts develop semi-functional joints as a lucky by-product of some other goal (see the third bullet below for more on the insidious quality of a competitive culture), but quite often with significant blind spots that often materialize as injury for the mover down the road. In the worst cases, these workouts literally cause injury. Our third, perhaps most insidious, obstacle to functional bodies is the way that society has told us to measure ourselves. Somewhere along the line, we were told that simply functioning well was not enough. No--we needed to be a specific size, or color, or socio-economic status, or  or What Im really talking about are the unseen but omnipresent forces that shape all of us, all the time: status (wealth/poverty), xenophobia (fear of others), misogyny, racism, shame, and the rest. If nothing else, I believe we should all start by being aware of these forces. And then work to eradicate them--as much as that is possible given our deeply primate brains. As coaches, we see people getting stuck by each of these obstacles all the time. So as a company that wants to make things better, we need to look at how to guide our students who are working around/through/with one or more of these challenges. We do that by focusing on the coach-student interaction--the right group size, the right program/plan, the right focus (on joints!), the right assessment, the right coaching approach, and the right learning environment. Each of these components, combined together as thoughtfully as possible, have a chance at effectively shaping someones outcome. These past two newsletters (from me) have been a long-way round of saying something simple:  Helping you develop functional joints, that you can trust, and then using that body control to build whatever physical capability you wish, is why The Fitness Alchemists exists. We stand by that mission because we can clearly see--in the physical movement and actual reports from our long-term students--the effect of having functional joints on the quality of your life.Our business has continuously angled toward forwarding this simple mission, and sometimes things jump forward. In that spirit, next week we have some big news to share... Until then, Coach Will",

      "text": "Have you ever had to rebuild trust with someone who betrayed you?What helped you learn to trust them again?How long did it take?Coach Hannah, here. Im willing to bet that there were some common elements present in the process of rebuilding trust, including:Consistent behavior (i.e. the person showing up when they said they would)Small gestures that built to larger onesAll of the above building over timeWhen someone hurts us, or betrays our trust in some significant way, in order to trust them again we need for them to earn it.Typically, this doesnt happen in one heroic gesture of trustworthiness. More often than not, it takes us seeing them as reliable in many small instances over a long period of time, before we truly believe that they are a safe person we can fully trust.This is the same process we need to go through to rebuild trust with our bodies after an injury or pain experience.If your upper traps have been in pain on and off for months, treating yourself to one amazing massage to relax those muscles isnt going to change their trust in you as their caregiver. That is the equivalent of your lover buying you an overly large & expensive bouquet of flowers to make amends for breaking your heart. Its not enough.Those muscles have been telling you that things arent right, that they need different inputs of care, for months. Thats what pain is -- your body communicating that something isnt working, that it doesnt feel safe.Each time you ignore that pain signal from your neck & shoulders (or numb it) so you can keep going, you are eroding the trust your body has in YOU to keep it safe and healthy.The longer that goes on, the longer it may take to rebuild that trust.This is not meant to be a chastisement, it is simply meant to help you recalibrate your expectations of change.And to help you understand your role in rebuilding trust.Trust is the foundation.You need to be able to trust your body, your body needs to be able to trust you. Without that, the pain will persist. The range of motion will stay limited. Youll feel tight in all the same places.Its so easy to fool ourselves into thinking that the heroic gesture is the answer, and that the small things we can do for ourselves arent enough, and therefore arent worth doing.If there is one thing Ive learned first hand from my recent injury, its that there is no gesture heroic enough to build that trust bridge in one go. What has made the biggest difference is the small things, done daily, that add up slowly over time.Thats why I get up early to do my CARs before I start training at 6:30am. Its why I stay up a few minutes after my partner has gone to bed to do one more set of PAILs and RAILs before I call it a night. Its why I take breaks from the computer and do my breathing exercises, even though it interrupts my writing flow.These are the ways I show up for myself. These are the inputs that prove to my body that I am a responsible caregiver of her needs. These are the building blocks of trust.To your resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "Bonjour, cest Coach Will, with major news (read on), and waxing poetic...Time, as they say, only moves in one direction.Always forward, onward, into entropy.Into disarray, chaotic apartness.Our only hedge against this overwhelming direction is to organize our Space, to give ourselves the field of awareness in which we might happily enjoy that inscrutable, non-negotiable dissolution into chaos that is Time.This language of physics is studied and pursued precisely because it can sufficiently describe the actions of physical objects large (universe/galaxy/Big Bang) and small (quarks/neutrons/Higgs bosons), as well as all the sizes of things in between.Which is why it is so important that we understand how the laws of physics interact with our own bodies, at the perfectly life-size scale of Us.How does Space manifest in the corners of our bodies? Is there enough Space (for movement and dreaming and loving and striving)? Can your brain feel (articulate) the edges of that Space?These are physical questions about your body that inevitably lead you to focus time and training on your joints--your fulcrums of movement and awareness--themselves governed as much by the laws of physics as by the laws of biology, psychology, neurology, physiology, and all the other, you know, actual science (!!!).But how about space on other scales? How do you feel in terms of consciousness space? Do you have room to mentally maneuver? How about the space inside your guts? Are things happily gliding, or painfully cramped? Relationally? Professionally?In any given situation where Time is a component (e.g. Life), having adequate space is essential for harmonious equilibrium. Its not even just a matter of amount of space. Its a Goldilocks problem: not too much (cant control well), not too little (no room to move!)--just the right amount.Which is why we are so excited to announce that we have secured a lease for our own, dedicated facility--The Fitness Alchemists HQ ;)--in the Lower Dimond neighborhood of Oakland.Of course, many more details to come, but for now we are over the moon to find out what things look like given the adequate room to maneuver.In the game of life, having the right space makes all the difference. We could not be more excited to share this next, spacious phase of our business with you.To finding your gold,Coach Will",

    "Find The Culprit": {
      "text": "I got the following response from a client after my email about time travel (Coach Hannah, here):I realized while watching your video that the process of keeping an eye on all of those things is not about regret (usually) but about monitoring, remembering what caused me problems in the past in order to hopefully avoid them in the future.Have you felt like this? I sure have.When we get hurt, we want to know: what did I do yesterday that made me feel pain today?We want to find The Culprit.Was it the kettle bell swings?Was it the extra 3 books in my backpack?Was it the weird way I got out of the car?We dont want to feel the pain we are feeling now EVER AGAIN (and believe me, yall, this has been REAL for me with this most recent injury) so we think, If I can just isolate what I did that made me hurt and NEVER DO THAT AGAIN, Ill be safe.Right? Seems logical.Some practitioners also buy into this philosophy. Ive heard from many clients that their doctor/physical therapist/chiropractor/previous trainer, etc told them that the solution to their pain is to avoid certain positions, movements, or activities FOREVER.Let me take a clear stand on this issue: Any practitioner that tells you the solution to your pain is to avoid certain positions, movements, or activities FOREVER is setting you up to fail.First of all, its impossible to monitor yourself 24/7. If youve ever woken up with a stiff neck or a weird pain from sleeping in a funny position, youve proven my point.There are always going to be blindspots in our ability to surveil our actions. We just cant monitor ourselves that closely.In my case, this injury came from a fall. I lost my balance in a weird partner movement game and went down, landing on my hip on a hardwood floor. I was so in it, and the adrenaline was so high, I didnt even register that incident as an injury that day. Life is a dynamic sport! Shit is going to happen outside our control.Secondly, our pre-frontal cortex (conscious mind) really is not designed to police the actions of our body. Our nervous system and physical body (muscles/tendons/joints) are wayyyyyy smarter at the task of physical self-preservation than our thinky-brain ever could be.We just need to feed the ol nervous system the right inputs and make sure we are training our meat suits to be more resilient to external forces than it was pre-injury.You see, in the simplest terms, an injury happens when the load (stress) applied to a tissue exceeds the load-bearing capacity of that tissue.This is good news.With appropriate training, we can slowly & incrementally load our tissues such that they become more resilient to the kinds of stress and insult that life delivers.This is our ticket to never being hurt by that same position, action, or movement that caused our injury.So you can go on a witch hunt for the movement or action you took YESTERDAY that caused your pain. But the reality is, the tissue that failed was most likely working above its capacity for some time-- days/months/years--it just finally gave out.Capacity is gained and lost over time. Not in one action, not in one day.Rather than trying to find The Culprit, youll be better served by systematically upgrading your weakest links so that you are resilient to whatever life throws at you.It wont happen in one training session, or from reading this email. But it is possible, and we are here to help.Go find your gold,Hannah",

      "text": "Even when we know WHAT to do, it can still be a struggle to find time to do it.I was just chatting with a client after class today about this very phenomenon. Coach Hannah, here. He is about to go on vacation for 3 weeks, and was asking about strategies to keep himself in the groove of his movement practice while on the road.Do you guys have any videos? I just notice that Ill get distracted and lost in thought when I try to exercise on my own, and then I dont get very much done.We have a few, I hedged, but better yet, just set a timer.His eyes lit up inquisitively.I continued, Pick 3 exercises you know you need, set a timer for 20, 30, 40 minutes -- whatever you can devote to your practice -- and do as many high quality sets as you can in that time.He looked relieved. Thats great! I can totally do that.Sometimes we just need a container to help us do the thing.You know how I learned that the timer trick works?BECAUSE I GET DISTRACTED TOO and feel like there is too much other important shit to do and fail to make time for my movement practice.Regularly. Still. Even though I am a movement professional and have been teaching for almost 10 years.So give it a go.Pick 3 moves you know your body needs,Set a 20 minute timer on your magical smart phonePut your phone on do not disturb and vow to not touch it until the timer goes offand then MOVE.Im gonna sign of now and do the same.See you on the other side,Hannah",

    "The Mystery of Energy": {
      "text": "Someone on some podcast I was listening to (Coach Will here, btw) mentioned Richard Feynman recently. It was the 80th time for me (and I still hadnt read anything by the Nobel-prize winning physicist), so I picked up a short sampling of his lectures called Six Easy Pieces.The title is a joke, because the book is 6 essays on the hardest damn ideas known to man. Things like gravity, and energy, and quantum stuff.But its ok. In Feynmans words, anyone who says they understand quantum physics doesnt understand quantum physics (its...unknowable, currently. I guess. Shrug).After all, theres value in not knowing things, too. In knowing what you dont know, and generally knowing what it is to be ignorant.Which leads me to one of the sentences in the slim volume that has stuck with me, gnawed at me: we dont really know what energy is.We all know what energy feels (push, force, heat) and looks like (light). And the first law of thermodynamics tells us that theres a conservation in energy--it must come from and go somewhere, but new energy is never created.But we also realize, in some sense, that energy is unknowable. For example: where does it come from? It is the water the fish swims in, the medium of our lives, so ubiquitous that it disappears to us.As Feynman explains, we only know how to measure the energy of a system before and after tiny events. Using lots of math we can prove that all of the energy was accounted for between our measurements. But we certainly dont (currently) have a way of seeing energy as it moves.What?Well--it seems that the world, at its tiny-est scales, operates between the cracks of our awareness. Were left trying to grasp (guessing, literally, via probabilities) where and when energy is.I was out of my depth in the physics realm from page one of reading, but what I saw Feynman talking about is something Im more familiar with: how even as it cant quite be observed explicitly, energy is apparent to us, intimately..See, while we cant capture energy itself, exactly, we can trace its literal path through us.DO THIS: Lean your head over to the side, feel a stretch on the opening side of your neck. Thats a line of tension, formed through a regular, recurrent pattern of loading (in this case, the force involved with hanging your shoulder from your ear). You just felt the evidence of energy moving through the system of your neck.Each force (energy) our bodies experience is absorbed and dispersed by the masses of tissue that make us up. So even while we cant really perceive energy exactly, we have a deep awareness of it all the same.Consistently applied forces with enough zeal behind them to actually demand a response from your tissue signal your cells to go to work--to adapt your body--in response to the stressor. And that tissue? It will now be changed, characterized by an increased resilience to exactly the forces that kicked off the adaptation in the first place.At the end of the day, we are only as capable in our various ventures as our tissue is able to absorb and disperse forces--without, that is, going bang (or pop, rip, tear, crunch, etc) and manifesting as an injury. More than any other single physical purpose, our bodies indicate that we are purpose-built for energy-dispersal, in all its many forms.In this way, we know exactly what energy is.We can feel it, and we bear evidence of its constant march all around, and indeed through, us. And we can direct it, as movement (and therefore, vibration, expression, conversation, art, performance, speed, etc, etc). But more on that another time.Go disperse some energy (and find your gold),Coach Will",

      "text": "This is such a juicy topic, there will probably be a series of emails from me about this jewel in the crown of self-care. (Coach Hannah, here, bringing you a tasty morsel to nosh on for your Friday fun-nourishment.)Today I want to harken back to my last email about setting a timer to help you get your workout done.I got so many responses from yall saying how helpful that email was--yay! So glad I could make doing the good stuff your body needs even a little bit easier.Its funny how a little external boundary, like a timer, can make a complex thing much simpler.I think it has to do with feeling accountable to something outside of ourselves.You ever notice that if you make a promise to yourselfIm going to wake up early and go running every day this week!...its super easy to break itIm so tired, Ill just hit the snooze button ONE more time, and go running TOMORROW!But if you make a promise to someone elseI booked an appointment at 6am with my personal trainer!...you make that shit happen like its your actual job?**shows up to the gym at 5:45 to stretch before said personal training session**WHY IS THAT???Turns out most of us fall into one of 4 categories when it comes to meeting expectations:Upholder you do equally well meeting external or internal expectationsObliger you meet external expectations easily, but struggle to meet internal expectationsQuestioner you are skeptical AF until you get enough information to satisfy you, and then you can easily rise to meet internal or external expectationsRebel you avoid meeting internal OR external expectations with equal ferocityFor more on this, and a handy quiz to help you figure out which camp you belong to, check out Gretchen Rubins post about this phenomenon. I highly recommend taking the quiz even if you think you know which one you are--you might be surprised!So whats the point of all this?If you know what kind of container you need to get things done (internal vs external expectations, more information, a rebel tamer, etc) you can then RESOURCE YOURSELF.Self-knowledge is the jam, am I right?If the scenario of running vs meeting a trainer sounds familiar, you are most likely an Obliger, and you need some external accountability to help you build new habits and get things done.Thats cool! Youre in good company -- Im an Obliger too.Its part of the reason being a coach works for me: I feel accountable to my students to be a leader who leads by example, and therefore I take better care of myself than I otherwise would because I know yall are looking up to me.So thanks for that!Getting back to boundaries. When you want to make time for a new thing, you have to limit something else, which will mean saying no to something or someone so that you can say yes to yourself. This isnt easy if its new practice.Hell, it isnt easy for me some days and Ive been practicing it for a while now!The more you know about yourself, and how you work best, the more power you have in your corner.Keep digging, friends.Yours in alchemy,Hannah",

    "Fear Formulas": {
      "text": "What do you feel is not allowing your knee to get higher?I (Coach Will here ) had my hand a few inches above my students knee, as they stood basically still, save for the tiny tremble of effort through their whole body. They were standing tall on one leg while drawing their other knee in front of them as high as they could.Its a position that clearly--and demandingly--reflected the students active hip flexion; how far could their hip joint rotate forward, into a flexed shape, at this exact moment?As their brain skittered around, trying to hold every last part of the body still (via intense internally generated forces, or contractions), I could tell that they were parsing my question. They were reaching into themselves, scanning for a clear, coherent signal amidst the bombardment of active, taut sensation.My...fat, I guess, they said sheepishly, touching the folds of skin near their belly button.There are moments, in regular daily life, when we stumble across a fissure, a small gap, that reveals the inner turmoil that defines each of us. There is fear there, but also a whole hidden mechanism to manage that fear, and make us presentable to ourselves.Each of our fear formulas is necessarily different, reflecting different experiences and struggles, and therefore manifest different rationalizing mechanisms. But when it comes to body-image, in our modern world that struggles as deeply with over-consumption as it does with starvation, that fear formula has one factor that seems nearly universal: shame about body-fat.Of course, society had pummeled (as it does each of us) this student--from early childhood--into seeing themselves as needing such a mechanism in response to their body-fat.It had force-fed them images of digitized thinness; it had capitalized on food-industry-sponsored research that demonized those long chains of hydrocarbons called fat to sell them food in bright packages; it had distilled the infinite manifestations of curiosity and joy and beauty into a single, non-real form that was only characterized by what it lacked: body-fat.Reinforcement from well-meaning parents, friends, family, doctors, coaches, teachers and trainers had only made the message more clear: Fat is wrong. I am fat. I am wrong.Society had shaped an image that wasnt true (ones body fat level is not a good indicator of overall health), but was a daily source of fear and pain, demanding the complex, rationalizing inner dialogue that made their body livable.Standing there, hip-flexed, sweat just beginning to emerge from their brow, I saw my student had gazed into this inner space. And more, I could tell that they had suspended their inner cacophony of judgement, for just a moment.They set their leg down, giving in to the fatigue from powerful end-range training. I dont really touch that part of my body, they said.My heart broke a little.In a flash, I could see them as a child, watching their mother struggle with diet after diet; I could see them in college, changing outfits three times before going out with friends to try and cover their belly; I could see them recently after work, bone-tired and hating their own hunger.I could see how much of themselves they had shoved into the shadows, out of their own reach. And I could see that, maybe for the first time, when they touched the tissue at their belly they felt more than the shame of too much fat.They felt their skin, and their fat, but also their heat, and the tension of muscles and tendon. They felt the incessant but calm churn of their gut biome. They felt the power and precision of the human hip complex, a feat of evolved engineering, millions of years in the making.Too engrossed with the demand of the simple hip-flexion task to run the same-old script of self-hate, and further engaged by my gentle questions (and not more criticism), they had momentarily brought their midsection back into the light of their consciousness. There was fear there, surely, but much more too.Nothing wrong with touching your belly, I said, smiling. Lets do another rep.Go find your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "I burst into tears on my way to work 3 days ago.It was just after 6am, and I (coach Hannah) was at the stop light at MacArthur & Harrison.While waiting for the light to change, my mind started running through the inventory of people who have offered to help us with the new studio. Some of these offers have already been accepted and played through, others are still waiting in the wings.All of a sudden, as I ran down my mental list of all of the humans who want our business to succeed -- who want us to make the thing that matters the most to us -- I felt overwhelmed with gratitude and tears rolled down my freshly washed, barely awake face.I was so scared to take this step.6 months ago, Will and I talked about it over lunch. Part of me knew it was the right thing to do, but I just felt nauseous and unworthy.A few months later, Will picked me up to go see our first retail listing. He looked over at me, his excitement palpable in the air, and said How ya feeling, Han?Terrified. I said flatly. I wish I could say I felt differently, but thats where Im at.I cant tell yall how grateful I am for Will. He steadfastly kept us putting one foot in front of the other on this new-home search. I could not have done it without him.And now, here we are!Lease signed, construction in progress, designs flooding in, equipment on order, and I finally feel excited. Ready. And so pumped to offer OUR version of fitness alchemy to the world.In that spirit, I wanted to send out a little more info about the new space!We will be located on the corner of Fruitvale Ave & School Street, in the Dimond neighborhood. Its right off the Fruitvale exit on the 580, and YES THERE IS PARKING. Free street parking for blocks and blocks. Not to mention a free park & ride city lot a few blocks away.We removed the old flooring:          And made some new doorways to help folks flow from the entry way into the changing rooms, and back to the bathroom, all without having to set foot on the training floor.          We have had the pleasure of working with some amazing carpenters, who are helping us bring our pipe dream of a wood feature wall that has the function of stall bars to life. Check out this rad design drawing:          Its going to be even more beautiful than we ever imagined.We are close to nailing down the class schedule and membership offerings-- more on that soon!There is still A LOT to do, so if I am slow to respond to emails and texts over the next 2 months, please bear with me! I appreciate all of you so much -- wouldnt be able to make this thing without you.Thank you for reading, thank you for being here.With a full heart,Hannah",

      "text": "Coach Will here with a confession: I have a nasty habit of referring to shitty joints.Most of the time, Im pretty friendly--promise!But in my world-view, our bodies only have two kinds of joints: joints that work, and joints that dont (the latter being the shitty ones :).In trying to make sense of the chaotic, seething knot that is the living human body, the most useful model I have found is the functional joints-first approach (functional = able to move with control and without pain).By simplifying all of our movement potential (literally the infinite ways we could move) to the basic mechanisms that create that movement--a joint--we have a lense into what defines the movement potential.Said another way: all the factors that limit how you move, that shape the arc of your movements, that determine where and how you can move, is and will always be generated by your joints. They are you corners, your leverage points*. You live and move--or dont--by them.With that as a starting point, the whole notion of exercise transforms.See, exercises are little patterns we devise (cue evil finger tapping) that attempt to isolate certain variables that we want to change and then, through repetition, go about changing them (or actually, convince the systems of your body to change them for us).But oh so often, that whole idea gets lost in the echo-chamber of bro-tastic fitness-land. Your squat, rather than a simple pattern that powerfully coordinates hip, knee and ankle flexion, becomes a mental monument, another inner abstraction for us to worship.And the goal (Improve hip, knee and ankle coordination) becomes nothing more than a pissing contest.Which segues quite nicely back to shitty joints. Because if I start praying to an abstraction (in this case, the squat) that assumes working parts (the joints of my hip knee and ankle) that I dont possess, Im not going to get what I want.Im not going to get much of anything, actually. Im not going to powerfully coordinate my hip, knee, and ankle...because I dont have them. Im not going to get RIPPED or SHREDDED or BE A BADASS.Im gonna get shit. Compensation, imbalance, compromised function, and maybe even a little (or a lot) of pain.Instead, what if we only did exercises--repetitions--of movements for which we were prepared? What if we only used the leverage points that actually existed, and only to the degree (range of motion) that they existed?Sound impossible to exert such control? In real life, it probably is. The world is too chaotic.But in the gym? In the lab (gym), where we control variables? Well, thats easy. And fun :).Gradually, a non-existent joint (the shittiest kind) becomes a little less shitty. A little more capable and resilient. Awake. Aware. And pretty soon its not shitty at all.It works.This summer, as Hannah and I (and the whole TFA community around us) go about building this new training facility--to do exactly what I describe here--I cant help but smile at the parallel to the creation of joint space, in the physical bodies of our students. At what might happen as we systematically work through, and beyond, shitty joints.People might move more because they want to. Because it feels good. Because theyve stopped insulting their limited joints, and started building them.Hell, I might even clean up my language.Naahhhhhh.Go find your gold,Will*I always forget if it was Archemides or Jesus who said, Give me a lever, and I will be your cornerstone.

      "text": "Birthdays are always a little weird for me. (coach Hannah, here, writing to you on my actual day of birth.)I was an only child of a single mother, so ALONE was the default for me. I spent more time by myself than I wanted to, and as a result, constantly craved company.Its only in the last year (2019) that I have come full circle on alone time. These days, I really like being alone. I see it as a chance to connect with myself, to fill my cup.I no longer see it as a yawning chasm that I desperately need to fill with company. I actually feel hungry for alone time when I dont get enough.This is a new jam, for me yall!Growing up, birthdays were a big deal in my house. My mom would encourage me to plan elaborate theme parties--whatever my little heart could dream up. But the parties were always a bit of a let-down.The experience never lived up to the anticipated fantasy.Ive finally squared with the fact that piling ALL THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE into one venue for a few hours is actually a bad idea. Its stressful. And it doesnt allow me to connect with each person in the deep and intimate way that makes our relationship sing.So now I embrace the concept of a birthday month and I make lots of celebratory moments with smaller groups of curated people.This year, I also made a playlist, in case you want to dance with me during my birthday month.How do you celebrate yourself? Whats your ideal scenario?I invite you to inquire into this subject, and see if what you *think* you want (aka what you usually do) is really what your truest self is really craving.Love,HannahP.s. this might be the best birthday present this year:          ",

      "text": "Well hello0o there!Its been a minute since I had a moment to sit down and put some words down (Coach Will here). But more on that in the next couple weeks...These days Im fully pickling myself in Functional Range Conditioning. Training it in myself and others every day for the last 18 months has led me to really consider its impact.And then my dad asked me yesterday if learning about Functional Range Conditioning had affected my experience while playing the trumpet.I paused, and realized that of course it had. But I had never thought about it before.Trumpet has been a part of my life for 21 years. It has been the source of some of my proudest, most defining moments and some of my hardest defeats.After conservatory in Boston, I looked at the financial prospect of playing trumpet full time, and it looked like a losing proposition for me. I loved the music, but couldnt tame my bodies unconscious response to old, deep triggers that were brought on most when I was on stage.But then FRC came along in my life. Within the first hour of my first seminar, I could see that what Dre had imagined was a system, loosely but clearly defined (and backed up with clinical study), that incorporated all the complexity that mattered to humans moving themselves.It allowed clear structure for how to reshape tissue, how to mold it to function, to fit, for each person's individual needs. It described the slow-motion transformation of injured tissue into random tissue, into coherent, resilient, force-dissipating tissue.And amazingly, it allowed a window into the stories--physical as much as psychological--that my body held as truth. The stiffness in my hips mirrored the stiffness in my thinking. I was blind and not welcome to the very outer reaches of my anatomy simply because they didn't matter to me. Instead, I was deeply invested in metrics that didn't actually matter to me. I was limited by an identity that was narrow by choice, one that allowed me distance from those triggers.In my reading, I had understood that the process of integrating triggering experiences with your current reality in progressive and systematic ways is pretty much the definition of trauma rehab. And that's what the concepts of FRC let me do with my physical body, including my music making.I hadnt realized the direct and impact-ful impression, straight from FRC, of finally seeing the body as a system of interacting elements. An infinitely complex but elegantly simple organism.The simple part is knowing the language with which this mass of cells speaks to itself (and to each other/cell(s): FORCE. Apply liberally where you need more information. Condition the weak ranges (HINT: every end position is weak!).The complex part is how that force specifically has adapted your body to this exact moment on earth. Seen from the other way around, the complex part reflects, in tissue, the incredible, diverse, near superhuman ability of physical specialists (athletes, surgeons, musicians, etc).Of course, guiding that tissue is an astounding network of cells that we barely understand--our brain, spine and the rest of our nervous system. But again, that complexity is succinctly distilled by the physical shape and behavior of our living tissue. How you move your joints is how you feel the world.Our physical lives are a beautiful struggle, unique to each of us. The only way we get to be in on the conversation is if we know, fluently, the literal way our bodies communicate and store information about the forces we experience.Once you can speak, and understand, you can make any kind of magic music you like. I'll play trumpet ;).Looking forward to writing a bit more regularly over the next few months.Go find some gold,Coach Will",

    "Our number one goal...": {
      "text": "Recently I had a long-term student tell me that they had finally learned what FRC and Kinstretch is, and they learned about it by Googling it.Meaning, the deepest underpinnings of our training approach (over the last 2-3 years, at least), had been obscured for her.Once this student (again, by Googling ) saw these fundamentals, she much more clearly understood why we had structured our new training program as we have.On the one hand: Woo! She got it! On the other: why hadnt we taught these lessons clearly enough? Why did she need Google?That lack of clarity meant she was spot on when she continued: You guys could have done a better job with onboarding.Yes, we could have.After I got over the shock of my failure as her teacher (#truthhurts), I started thinking about how we could be more clear about what we do.So it is in the spirit of illumination--for our current students and as an introduction to some newbies on this newsletter--that I want to tell you about what we, The Fitness Alchemists, do...We are interested in exploring how a clear, coherent physical signal in someones life might help them become more of who they are, more of themselves.While we are certainly in the business of physical training (and therefore under the fitness umbrella), our training looks a lot different than most of what you see in the media.To put it simply, we prioritize the independence of your joints over all else. We make the quality, quantity and sophistication of your back, shoulders, hips, and toes (and all the rest :) our number one goal.We take this approach because of what weve learned from the Functional Range Conditioning-- FRC fer short --framework. FRC is known as much for its seemingly off-the-wall exercises all over social media (like CARs  aka Controlled Articular Rotations, and tons of isometrics) as for its association with the creme de la creme of professional sports (literally, almost all major sports teams/organizations use FRC directly with their athletes). Kinstretch is the group-class application of these concepts.But hidden inside this trendy-feeling system is a well of scientific truths, mined meticulously by a bunch of sweethearts from Canada, that give evidence of what has been measured, observed, and quantified (aka Science) in regards to our joints.This kind of firm, researched backstop provided us with clarity about what we see our students need in their lives.After almost two decades of shared experience, we (Hannah and I) concluded that the number one obstacle for the humans under our guidance was the quality of their joints.Movement generally was nearly the best thing for a humans physical health, but in most cases of inactivity there was one (or more) major joint limitations that were directly prohibiting movement.On the other hand, given sufficient joint quality (which we define essentially as joints that have the adequate range of motion and conditioning to match the needs of their lives), people could do whatever they wanted.Im serious. The difference was stark.Assuming there is room to operate (i.e. enough active soft tissue holding enough space between your bones), movement is easy, fluid, and available.But without that space? Well, were f*ckt.Essentially, joints hate to be confined. Without movement, USE, and the accompanying flow of nutrients, our ability to feel our joints starts to die, which slowly makes us blind to our ability to contract in those zones.That blindness leads to muscle atrophy, which leads to a loss in energy as your metabolic rate drops. Everything becomes harder, life stiffens up.Fortunately for us humans, that tune can be played backwards, too*.When people start with us, they usually need to realize that they even have joints. Yup, as in... Oh, that ole shoulder blade? It moves?! WhoaaaThen, they need to feel the slightly-odd (because its new) sensation of being strong in new places: deep stretches, fatiguing isometrics, and a veritable tour of (muscle) Cramp City.And then they need to just do it.As in SHOW UP......to class....to learn....and most importantly, for yourself.Ill say it again: Show up for yourself.Listen to your body, and your feelings, and thoughts.Go to a class, do CARs at home, learn about your body, by feel, one joint at a time, and patiently witness your body become more resilient, capable, and tuned-in.In my experience...with that awareness comes curiosity, which brings joy, and wisdom.As a teacher, I am continuously swept away with my curiosity about what each of us can/could do, given sufficient freedom and information to find sufficient joint space.Because when we do, we can be ourselves, just more.And that is always a beautiful, human thing.Go find your gold,Coach Will*I love me some backwards music.",

      "text": "Hey Team,Its been a while since Ive been able to write to you, but Ive been thinking about you A LOT. (Coach Hannah, here  hayyyyy!)Turns out, opening a new studio is an ever expanding amount of work. Im starting to have that real-real empathy for new parents!But now that our baby is crawling and sleeping through the night, I wanted to send you a post from the archives [Sept. 5, 2018] that recently came up in several conversations with my friends & students. It begins with a tiny imaginative exercise, so if you would indulge me, please close your eyes and...Take a moment to conjure up the physical memory of the last time you felt the sting of being excluded from something you really wanted to be part of.Maybe you'll have to reach back to middle school - and remember not being invited to sit at the cool kids table. Maybe you have a more recent memory of running into a glass ceiling in your career. Parents, maybe you've felt the sting of your child getting to that age where they don't want you to be part of their fun anymore.Exclusion is one of the most painful feelings we encounter as humans.You might be wondering how this is relevant to The Fitness Alchemists. (Coach Hannah, here--bear with me!)Well, helping people who have felt excluded from the fitness world see that they do in fact belong, is the number one thing that PUMPS ME UP about my work.Seriously.I wake up early to do what I do everyday because I love helping people re-connect to their bodies and feel STRONG.This feeling of exclusion can come from different sources. Some of the most common sources that I encounter are:Pregnancy (Doctors are still giving women out-dated information about what type and intensity of exercise is safe during pregnancy - WiIl and I are pre-post natal certified, and we can help clear up the confusion!) I posted about this on InstagramGender and/or Sexual Orientation (most gyms are verrrrry gender binary and heteronormative - i.e \"men do THIS, women do THAT\" - this doesn't have to be the culture of fitness!Pain/Injury (Pain tells us a story that we can't participate in certain activities \"anymore\"-- there are likely more options than you think! We can help you reclaim them.)Age (while strength and fitness do come more easily the younger we are, with the right training and mobility practice, human beings can get strong and fit at ANY AGE!)Body size if you look at the pictures on the internet, it seems like Fitness is only for The Already Fit. This can create a feeling of I must be this fit/this size to ride this ride. NOT TRUE. All bodies at all sizes can be strong & powerful. I love supporting big bodied and fat identified folks to reclaim a relationship with fitness that isnt about trying to be smaller.Regardless of the source, this feeling of exclusion is the same:\"I dont belong in this spaceIm here to help you remember that you do belong.Strength belongs to all of us.Movement is our birthright.Your body is a good body. In fact, it is a miraculous self-healing machine.But sometimes we all need a compassionate guide to help us come back to ourselves.Thats where I come in.I want to help you unpack the stories youve been told that hold you back from feeling like strength is yours to own and express as you please.I want to help you feel present in your physical experience.I want to remind you that its ok to be exactly where you are, and that its ok to want more.Together can walk forward, at a realistic pace.Together we can laugh as we (inevitably) stumble.Its easy to get too serious about ALL THE THINGS. Lets giggle. Lets play. Lets put the work in. Lets feel the feels. I'm here for ALL of that.As a wise friend (and client) often says: Everything is going to be fine (for varying values of fine)You've got a place at our table,-HannahP.S. [back to the present day] We (Will & I) FINALLY have our own space in which to train. We are so excited to be able to create a culture of INCLUSIVE fitness at our new studio, where anyone who has felt like fitness isnt for them can reconnect to their body, define what fitness feels like for them, and step their way towards that personally meaningful goal. We are open to your feedback (And any resources you know if) as to HOW to create these inclusive culture. Please reply and be candid if there is something you see that could be improved!P.P.S if you are local to the Bay Area, we would love to have you come by and LITERALLY sit at our table this Friday, Nov. 15th 6-9pm at our Studio-Warming Open House! We will feed you delicious tacos, give you a tour of the new digs, and hopefully there will be some dancing towards the end of the night. Just a heads up  we are a shoe-less studio, so wear your best party socks!",

    "Discover, Rinse, Repeat": {
      "text": "In the 90s classic The Matrix, theres that indelible scene when Morpheus meets the somewhat confused Neo (played by the always somewhat confused Keanu Reeves) and offers him two options, a red pill or a blue one. (this is Coach Will here with story time)The options boil down to: a). Knowing whats going on, being able to start to see it --the Matrix--for what it is (RED pill) or b.) to stay blind, and ignorant (BLUE pill).Of course, this is a false choice  We humans have a soft-spot for seeking truth, once we are clear where we might find it. Even if were not convinced at first, even a nagging sense that theres more to the story can make us pull the thread.I think of this often as Im teaching Functional Range Conditioning. Seeing the responses on a students face, and hearing their questions, its as if Im pulling back the curtains on a grand song-and-dance production. One discovery only leads to more questions.We love questions :).The reality, for me, and many, many others I have worked with, is: despite living with ourselves, many of us have an extremely vague sense of whats going on under the surface of our bodies.We have little to no dialogue with the mechanism that moves us, thinks for us, feels for us, and delivers us wherever were headed in life.And that lack of communication makes us nervous (and rightly so), especially when the mechanism starts to break down or act in unpredictable ways. We cope with that nervousness by trusting others, outsiders to the body-self conversation, far beyond ourselves.That means that at our studio, with new students, we first must instigate conversations between humans and their bodies, a conversation that may have been dormant for months, or years.And while these may not be vocalized conversations necessarily, (although I definitely talk to myself :), they are literal feedback loops--dialogues--between sensory tissue (nerves in your body) and decision making tissues (brain).And heres where the Red Pill/Blue Pill choice comes into view: once the dialogue is initiated, and someone is actively trying to control their body, theres no more not knowing.Theres no hiding from what your hip can actually do, or how much of your spine can actually function. How far your shoulder can actually reach without pain.And that realization may be emotionally painful, even as it acknowledges and respectfully steers us away from physical pain.But luckily, the harshness of freshly opened eyes slowly recalibrate. With time, and continued dialogue, the nature of the relationship does begin to shift.Tissues that had previously been hidden from us start to emerge, and flourish with the attention (aka actually moving them!)A newly-respected shoulder begins to gain fluency in the range it can access.A hip, free from constant insult, starts to ask for more movement--more hiking, playing, exploring, strengthening.With that momentum comes a drive to learn, and see more (like, where exactly does my spine stop moving?). And with more truth, further discovery, we start the cycle anew.Discover, rinse (or power-wash, depending on your style ;), and do it again. Ad infinitum.While its not always a happy process, over time it always bends towards more real. And we think that is important, and fulfilling (and sometimes even happy!).At that moment in The Matrix, Neo, facing his choice, is completely unclear about the it that Morpheus is describing, and even so is sure what he must do. And as Neo reaches for the Red Pill, Morpheus says:All Im offering is the truth, nothing more.Go find your gold,Will",

    "What's your secret to success?": {
      "text": "We looooooove asking this question, dont we? (coach Hannah, here.)Theres an entire industry (PODCASTS) based on experts asking other guest experts what their secret sauce is. The eager interviewers ask their experts about their signature...morning routine...diet...exercise program...jade egg practiceYou name it, theres a podcast about it.And while I do think it can be helpful to hear what helped someone you admire get to where they are, I dont think its the MOST valuable thing you can do to help yourself.The most VALUABLE person you could interview about their secret to success is yourself.I stumbled upon this idea today while talking with a client.She has been working on adding 20 mins of daily walking to her routine. We check in each week, to see how its going. After weeks of fair-to-middlin (as my mother would say) traction with this new habit, today she was beaming before I even asked her about it.Ive been walking EVERY DAY she gushed.Thats awesome! I volleyed back, Whats your secret? Howd you make that shit happen this week?Her face reddened, The weather cooled off! I must admit that had a HUGE effect.Now, the weather isnt something we can control, but we still get super valuable information from this self-success-secret mining effort. We now know that she requires a temperate environment to consider walking. Now we can strategize that on hot days, she will automatically go to the air-conditioned gym instead of pretending she is going to walk outside in the sweltering heat.Knowing yourself is a superpower. Afterall, what worked for someone else, might not actually work for you. When you take the time to investigate WHAT ACTUALLY WORKED for you in your real every day life, you get a strategy that is tailor made for you guessed it YOU!I first learned about this practice in a great book called Switch, by Chip & Dan Heath. They call it Finding Bright Spots. The basic idea is to give yourself a little retrospective weekly or monthly to look back and take stock. If your goal is to do say, your CARs daily, and over the last week you only did them on 2 days out of 7, rather than focusing on the 5 days of failure zoom in on the 2 days of success.Ask yourself, what went right that day that allowed me to do my habit? Is there anything I can re-create to smooth the path for myself next week? Obviously there are some factors outside of our control, like the weather, but more often than not youll find a few things that contributed to your success that you can clone.Give this a go, looking back at the past week, and share with us what you plan to clone for next week, to create more Bright Spots!I look forward to hearing your secret to success,Hannah",

    "Let\u2019s make your team the DREAM TEAM (in 15mins)": {
      "text": " Im curious, do you work as part of a team? (Coach Hannah, here, with a Friday treat for ya)What happens when you are working towards a deadline, and one of your team members flakes out?As the saying goes, the show must go on, so usually what happens is the remaining team members are forced to adapt and get the job done somehow.This is the same thing that happens with the human body.Think of your joints as members of a team, each with a different specialty and function. The team works most efficiently when each player is doing their own job  expressing their unique role flawlessly.Of course the team can pull together and accomplish the goal when one (or more) players are out of commission, and the end result (The product) might appear (to the untrained eye) to be the same as if all players where participating, but the cost is higher to the players who actually pull off the job. Theres added stress. Theres resentment. Theres burnout.In the case of the human body, if your hip doesnt currently have the capacity that a human hip should, the rest of your joints will find a way to accomplish the job (be it running, doing crossfit, taking yoga, or just walking around and sitting at your desk).However, there will be a higher cost to the rest of your body, and eventually, someone will burn out.The daily practice that I am about to teach you in this video is a way to maintain the health of each joint (each individual player) so that they can continue to function to the best of their individual ability.It needs to be a daily practice in the same way that your teeth need to be brushed daily for optimal oral hygiene.Your joints (every single one of them) need to be taken through their full, pain-free, range of motion every day, in order to clear any plaque build up, and more importantly to deliver nutrition to the deep tissues of the joint itself.You see, muscles have veins and capillaries running through them, which means as long as your heart is pumping, they are getting fed. But your connective tissue (ligaments, tendons, spinal discs, meniscus, etc) do not have this same vascularity, so the ONLY way they get fed is through movement.Any kind of movement will help, but the rotational movements we share in this video deliver the most nutritious meal. Mmm-mm, tasty!Hopefully Ive whetted your appetite.Heres the video -- it will take only 15 minutes of your day, and will deliver exponential results with far-reaching benefits to your physical health.Feel free to share the love by forwarding this email to someone who needs it!To your teams resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "Hellllooooo!Coach Will checking in. It's been a minute since I've had a chance to write to all of you, and I miss it. It's a real pleasure to take a moment to try to coach via email.On one hand, it's always a feeling of \"how the hell do you try to talk to hundreds of people at once?\"But on the other, it's a chance to search for themes that resonate with all of us. Or, said a different way: how does fitness--and indeed all the stuff you do for movement, expression, health, or glory--actually fit into your life?What space does it take up in your thinking? How does it make you feel when you read or hear \"fitness\"?For some, it will be meaningless. \"Oh, you mean working out? I do that. Sometimes. Do stairs count?\"For others, it will be a religious experience: \"Fitness Changed My Life\"But for everyone, at any point on the spectrum,it offers a way into deconstructing your physical capabilities, and seeing your movement self with clarity. That deconstruction is humbling, and it can be quite intense. But it is a way toward areal-er moreembodiedsense of yourself.And that is why this work is meaningful to me.With the right exercise tools, you can start conversations with parts of your body that you had lost touch with, or always seem to argue with. You reveal frustrations and limitations, but also strengths and abilities that you didn't realize. And all of that means, necessarily, that you know how to start, where to begin. Because now, you can see (more) clearly.As tacky as New Years sentiments can be (whats so special about January, anyway??), I really like the one about 2020 being the year of better vision. It's a notion that inspires me, because it what special something it might unlock in each of us.Here's to seeing clearly what's really going on, inside and out. Cheers!Go find your gold,Coach Will",

    "How bodies contract": {
      "text": "Heya!One great suggestion that we got from our recent survey was to use this newsletter to keep teaching the tangible basics of joint health.So today I, Coach Will, want to talk aboutmuscle contraction. Let's start with a definition...To contract in the muscular sense simply means \"to shorten or tighten\".This action is signaled by the brain and is delivered to individual muscle fibers extremely rapidly via our nervous system.Depending on how the muscle contracts, the brain and/or body is learning how to do specific things, and over time and through repetition gets better at doing those things(adaption).First, we haveconcentric contraction. This is when muscle fibers slide past each other and the muscle belly effectively shortens (and tightens). This action causes bones to move toward each other, and (often) to counteract gravity. When you bend your elbow, the flow of tissue from your palm to your shoulder is contractingconcentricallyand the result is your hand comes toward your shoulder (and your bicep bulges). Some other examples include:the UP of a pull upthe UP of a push upthe UP motion of a squat.Next, we haveisometric contractions. These actions sufficiently tighten or stiffen (brace) a flow tissue such that it doesnt move often against the resistance of a force (gravity, a heavy, non-moveable weight, etc.).Isometric contractions predominate in your core, but dont be fooled; they are not just responsible for involuntary postural muscles. We can also use them to great effect to build strength, especially at ranges that are weak or unpracticed.By removing the complexity of movement, the brain can send more signal to one specific flow of tissue and learn how to be active there. We take one area and power-wash it with a spot-light, literally driving neural activity to the area.Finally, we haveeccentric contractions. As their name suggests, these muscle actions are a little weird :). As those same muscle fibers begin to slide apart, theyresistthis slide and effectivelyslow downthe lengthening motion.Imagine an icepick, dragging thru ice as you slide downhill, orthe heat from a rugburn as your butt slips down the stairs. That \"heat\" very often results inmicro-tears to your contractile tissue, akasoreness(which is why eccentric training can often make you themostsore).This heatin the muscleis caused by the active resistance from your tissue-brain team. This happens as you come DOWNfrom a pullup,push up or squat, or any time bones move apart under active control, or against aload.In our classes we specifically focus on each of these contractions for specific reasons:Concentricactions are most complex and demanding, and generally we areweakestat them. That weakness also means a big payoff when we can improve our ability to concentrically contract. Concentric contractions, especially coordinated with other contractions,require lots of brain practice to improve; after all, they are responsible for moving us thru the world.Isometriccontractions are tough, but are our best fool for improving the connection of our bodies and brains at specifictissues (especially the weak and/or untrained ones). We can becomeimmensely strong with them, even as we use them to improve our weakest link areas, and we can do it all extremelysafely(after all, no bones are moving).Eccentriccontractions essentially are our bodiesbrakes, our way ofslowing ourselves downand controlling our dynamic motion through the world. In the case of a pull up, imagine yourself lowering slowly. This demand has a particular signature (in brain waves) and leaves a distinct mark (sore!!) on our tissue. Its often a final stage of training tissue, in which we can work on and improveour actual resiliency (ability to withstand stressors).So, as you move around today, I encourage you to occasionally check-in and determine which of your tissues seem to be working, andhow.What kind of contractions are you using as you drink from a bottle? Or open a door? How about when you navigate stairs.We all deserve to know ourselves, especially the parts that work every day.As always, we'd love to help answer any questions that come up for you about this--just hit reply and an actual human will get back to you!Go find your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "Sipping coffee the other morning, staring at the clouds as they greeted the morning sun, I thought about how organically the worldcycles itself. (Coach Will here).How normal it is for natural phenomena--sunrises, weather patterns, etc.--to recur. And in comparison, I thought about how challenging that basic recursion is for us humans to harness ashabits.'Habits' sure is a buzz-word, but actually putting them into practice is no small thing. For how routine we humans are (like all of nature), it is odd how difficult it is to make that routinework for us.As a fitness coach, I came into the industry thinking that habits were simple. Just identify yourgoals,thenstart working toward your goals, every day, andvoila--you have betterhabits.Not so fast, junior.The more people I worked with, the more reasons I heard for why habits weren't sticking: work issues, shifts in energy-levels, or--the dark-horse--people got bored with them.So when we started the Fitness Alchemists, I realized we needed to take a different approach.We're NOT going to tell you to dream about your goals first. Goals are fine, and when clearly defined and meaningful for someone, can be a huge boost (especially as the going gets tough).But grasping for some goal-ish target to try to jump start your habit-engine just doesn't work. Instead, we will tell you tostart by tuning in--to your body, your needs, and your natural daily/weekly rhythms.We do this simply because flashy (but meaningless) goals tend to outshine the most important tool you can wield: a perception of your own experience.The first step to truly great habits is very often the act of simply realizing where--and how--you are right now.You can try this right now if you like.Close your eyes, and notice one part of your physical reality: the itch behind your ear, the twinkling lights behind your eyelids, the pressure of your butt on your chair.Really try it. Settle in and take a few slow breaths. I'll wait.That little moment is like a gap in a curtain, allowing you for just a second to start to notice what's really going on behind the fog of your brain's chatter. And if you can find a way to add this *practice* of observing--even 1 min/day--to your daily mix, you are adding the most powerful foundational habit of them all: honest self-assessment.In our experience, building a truly useful habit never happens through forcing great acts of will power, but rather by noticing the cycles of your life *right now*, and starting to shift them, through careful selection, in the direction that serves you better.Once you start trusting your ability to observe, then you can start naming what you find. Identify the stuff that serves you, and see how you can make that happenmore easily.How can you bolster the actions that feel good and propel you forward?Identify the stuff that drags you down, and find ways to let that drop away. Are you doing it because you \"should\", but has no connection to what really matters for you? You'll know if you're honest with yourself.Perceive, Identify, Fortify (the good stuff).That's it. Pretty soon, you have side-stepped your way into a cycle of living that worksforandwithyou, and isn't some huge obstacle that you'll \"fix\" with better habits. And whilebig changes do taketime,little shifts now provide the right context for wider and grander habits to flower later.And I'm convinced it all starts with tuning in.So here's your magic formula for building life-changing habits, again...Perceive, Identify, Fortify (the good stuff).Go harness the weather patterns of your life,Coach Will",

      "text": "Halloooooo!That's my trail greeting (Coach Will here btw).It's the voice I usewhen I'm out hiking to let people know that I'm happy to see them, whoever they are, even if I won't be walking near them :).Because through these days of social distancing, getting outside has been not only a chance to ground myself amidst the trees and dirt and sky, but also an opportunity to be in community with all of my neighbors who are as wrenched from their normal lives as I have been.Which is why I'm writing you today... I want to let you in on a little secret I have been experimenting with for the last year.It's calledStrava. It's free, and while it *is* a social network, I'm convinced that its upside far outweighs any misgivings I have about putting my social life online.Strava is built around the every-day outdoor adventures--by foot, bike, etc--of it's participants.For example: When I go for a hike, I'll turn on the Strava app so that it can record elevation, mileage, etc. Then, when I'm done, I post that adventure and anyone who is following me gets to see my route, get inspired or give encouragement. Because= awesome.That's it!It's all about doing, and sharing, adventures.(If you're a numbers geek like me, the info that Strava begins to compile/analyze for you is pretty fun too.)So as part of our push to support all of you during this sideways time, we have set up a club on Strava JUST for Alchemists (eg YOU). You'll need to make yourself a Strava account, but then you can request to join our club by searching for The Fitness Alchemists.Or justclick HEREand then click 'Sign-Up'.These are weird, tough times, and no one is that sure of anything.But you know what Iamsure of? The positive potency of getting outside AND feeling supported by people who care about us.Hope to see you on Strava soon!-Coach Will",

      "text": "What moves you? I mean, what makes you shift, change, or start something?What motivates you?When we dig into this question--as Coach Hannah and I did earlier this week--theres really another, more important question implied:howare you motivated?Are you motivated by a push, or pressure? Do you only get started on some project because you have to? Because of a deadline, or coercion? Do you rely on shame, fear or scarcity to get moving?Id call that kind of motivation the Stick. As the analogy goes, that is the low-key weapon that the rider wields to get their animal to move, inflicting just enough pain to create movement but not so much to injure their trusty beast.          The problem with this kind of motivation is that, unlike the horse above, there are wounds that are caused when were beaten by the proverbial stick, even if theyre not physically evident (although, occasionally, they are).These wounds happen to our psyche, to our thought-patterns and our capacity for awareness. For that reason, they arent exactly wounds, but actually just a kind of negative conditioning: when we are driven forward by coercion, fear and scarcity for long enough, we begin to rely on this pressure. We begin to believe that this visceral but negative kind of motivation is the only kind.Thankfully, its not. Behold, the Carrot.That is, the kind of motivation that is caused by your attraction or interest toward something. Toward something thing that makes you curious, and drives you to investigate.That forward impulse is often just as effective as the kind brought on by the Stick, but it conditions a whole different pattern in our psyche. Instead of reacting to fear-inducing stimuli, we heed the call of the reward center of our brain. We go after what we want.Motivation of this type has a distinct advantage: it compounds, and makes motivation easier over time. Even if your curiosity pushes you to investigate something that you then determine is not worth any more curiousity.Because rather than conditioning the same thought patterns that undermine your sense of agency (Stick), Carrot-motivation gives you momentum. As you satisfy your curiosity over and over you begin to find more, and the Sirens call of shame begins to be a bit easier to tune out.As a fitness coach, I talk about motivation all the time, with all different people. And personally and professionally, I do not choose to use the Stick as motivation. Ever.But that doesnt stop my students from using the Stick on themselves. And we all know the feeling--that hot, embarrassed wave of shame, generated and directed inward--that certainly can get us moving.If you have a ton of experience being moved in this way, but much less experience letting your curiosity drive you forward, which do you think will exert more power over you?And as you look to start new habits, try new things, explore new avenues and discover new layers to yourself, how will you go about motivating yourself?Seriously, hit reply and let me know!Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

      "text": "Hey team, Coach Will here.I grew up in a science-obsessed home. My father is a pioneer of artificial intelligence, and spent his career as a professor of computer science.My mother worked in biomedical engineering for a couple decades before switching course and embarking on a second career as an elementary and middle-school science teacher.As a child of these scientists, the concept of experimentation and inquiry for me was akin to religion in other households: a foundational set of beliefs that shaped how I made sense of the world.I had trouble (and still do) believing things that I have not proven for myself with a certain degree of certainty, but the only source of belief superior to rigorous personal inquiry was scientific truth. That is, the stuff that had been hypothesized, tested, and concluded based on a body of controlled experiments.Science offers me ground to stand on, stability in a world that more and more tends to obscure the very idea of facts as real.And while science doesnt explain everything--theres still more about the universe that we dont know than we do--it provides a solid backstop as we all continue to try and make sense of our world.It cant be legitimately denied, or forgotten, or ignored. It may not make sense, or give the full picture, but is never just a figment of imagination.Which is why we (Hannah and I) have been diligent about building The Fitness Alchemists around the established facts offered by science. While the cutting-edge anec-data is enough for other coaches, we decided early on that we were only comfortable training humans with tools based on therealitiesof the scientific literature.But while a part of what we do is actual, physical movement that we have grounded in science, another huge part of fitness coaching lies in theabstractrealm of goals, motivation, and mindset.And one of the most common goals people have coming into fitness (not just our program) is weight-loss.So I started to get curious about the science around weight-loss.What I found left medumbfounded.There is no clinical evidence supporting any method for long-term weight loss.No intervention--and there have been dozens of studies exploring this exact question--shows a way of losing weight and maintaining that lower weight long-term for all but a tiny percentage of people. (Almost every diet or exercise intervention causes temporary weight-loss).But you know what the sciencedoesshow? That stigmatizing weight and body size is literally bad for our mental and physical health. Again, this is supported by several studies.Theres plenty more science, too, that undermines most popular, common-sense thinking about body size, much more than I can get into here.Now, I have wrestled with this science because, again, as I coach I am confronted almost daily with the desires of some of my students (as well as potential clients and society at large) to lose weight.And one thing Im sure of is that I care deeply about helping my students.But how could there be such a gulf between the seemingly-rational goals of so many people (weight-loss) and the reality of the science?As I dug deeper, I found a perspective that helped me make sense of this dynamic:we are all (consciously or not) at the mercy of something calleddiet culture.This was a new term for me, and it might be for you, so Ill define it. Diet culture* is the system of beliefs that:Worships thinness and equates it with health and moral virtue;Promotes weight loss as a means of attaining higher status;Demonizes certain ways of eating while elevating others;Oppresses people who don't match up with its supposed picture of health,This is an issue that, considering my profession, I feel strongly about addressing publicly, startingnow.And be ready: the more I learn, the more I will be talking about it, if only because those around me should know clearly where I stand.And as always for me, it starts with the science, which indicates:diet culture is an insidious, undermining reality of modern life, and needs to be dismantled.What do you think?To finding your gold,Coach Will*definition fromChristy Harrisons website, which I strongly recommend as a starting point for learning about this issue",

    "Sharp or Dull?": {
      "text": "I think its fair to say we are all cooking more these days. All the choppinggggg. All the dishessssss. #thatquarantinelifeSpeaking of chopping, how are your knives holding up? Have you sharpened them lately? (I know mine are overdue... this is Coach Hannah btw hiiiiiiiiiiiii!)Have you heard that you are more likely to cut yourself with a dull knife, than with a sharp one?Its true.The duller the knife, the more downward force you have to apply to cut through the carrot. On to of that, the dull blade is less likely to get purchase into the flesh of the carrot, making git more likely to slip off course and cut you instead.A dull knife is harder to control.I think we can all agree that a knife (in order to be a more effective cutting tool) needs to be sharpened. No arguments there? Sweet.And yetImagine for a moment that you noticed your knives were dull, and your impulse to make them better was touse them for MORE cutting. Chop more vegetables. Slice more bread. Saw through more steaks.What would happen?For one, the knife would get duller, the more you used it. The tool would not improve.And two, the duller your knife got, the harder your cutting job would be.Youd have to apply more force (using more of your energy to do the same job).I think we can all agree that this just do the thing more approach doesnt make sense in the knife/cutting scenario.And yet, this is how so many folks tend to treat their tools of the bodies (aka the joints).\"If I just run more, my body will get better at running.\"\"If I do more pushups, Ill get a stronger upper body.\"Zooming in, each of these movements require many tools to make the meal happen.Lets take running.If the hip joint is dull and needs sharpening to be better at its role of propelling you down the road, just putting in more miles will not make that happen.The hip will go the way of the knife.It will stay dull, andyour body will have to expend more energyand tag in other neighboring joints (the lower back, knees) tomake up for what the hip isnt able to do, and get the job done.Luckily, we have ways to sharpen the tools of your body, so that you can become more efficient at whatever physical activities matter to you.Think of Kinstretch asyourknife sharpener.In this weeks class, we hone in on Hip Internal rotation, which is a key element to having sharp and efficient hips.Heres to efficient tools that enable you to be the best creator of your most epic life!Slice & dice,HannahP.S. do you have a particular joint that needs \"sharpening\"? We are happy to work in requests to upcoming classes, so please tell us what your body needs!",

      "text": "Happy Saturday team!Coach Will here, to say...It drives me nuts that in our culture, fitness is pigeon-holed as somehow belonging only to the already fit.This impossible, circular logic hinges on a sneaky tactic stolen from the diet-industry playbook:by only displaying the shiny/happy (read: high status) parts of the experience, the less-positive and even negative experiences that everyone will have areblamed on the individual. Basically, the wins are from adhering to some narrow definition of success, but the losses are your fault.The subtle tinges of morality that run through most fitness marketing, basically the idea that you will be a better person if you just... (fill in the blank), belie a total obsession with status and virtue-signaling.And the falseness of that premise makes me mad as hell.The reality of each and everyone of us is this: on the inside,there are pockets of light, corners of darkness, and lots of unknown.There are times when we are at our best, making an impact and feeling fulfilled, and there are moments that wed rather pretend were the words/actions of someone else. And filling in the gaps are miles of uncharted ground, not yet fully grasped or formed.Now, in the standard fitness narrative, the one that is aspirational and hell-bent on motivating everyone to  (fill in the blank), all the time (Yay!) there is simply no room for feelings of emptiness, or scarcity, or trapped-ness. Theres nospacefor not knowing yet, or struggle, or being in-process.And then when you get past the initial misgivings that all this ALL POSITIVE ALL THE TIME might not really capture whats going on for you, you are left to think that any time you hit a snag it is wholly your fault.But thats wrong. Its not your fault.Its the fault of an industry not willing to see itself (or at least not the not-so-shiny parts).Its the fault of trainers who impose their internalized fatphobia on their clients, its the fault of marketers who write headlines just for the clicks, and its the fault of gym owners and influencers who try tofixyour strugglesfirst,rather than acknowledging them, and meeting youwhereandhowyou are.Thankfully, today we have an alternative.We have the chance to leverage the observed scientific principles that govern our bodies towardour own ends. Until quite recently, we were forced to rely entirely on our own experience or on the suspect opinion of coaches--suspect because they were themselves relying solely on their own experiences.And while there is surely value in those inputs, there is also a lot of room for fantasy and false-narrative.The fact that there is published, peer-reviewed information that we can put into action makes this science-based path the obvious choice if we are interested in tangibly changing our physical bodies.We have an opportunity to use these next-level tools to exert some power over our own experience, to direct our lives in the direction we want to go, and to do the things that matter to us.But if were forced to buy some shiny/happy crock o shit to even just get in the door, those tools will go unused! And all of us will keep thinking that our struggles with the process of change represent an individual failure.Change is hard, jagged and uneven, and happens in fits and starts. And thatsno onesfault.What is changefeelinglike for you these days?- Coach Will",

      "text": "         By far the biggest challenge weve been hearing from clients through Shelter-in-Place is simply rousing the energy/motivation/drive to work out at all.During the best of times, getting yourself to do the thing can be a challenge, and these certainly are not the best of times. Even when you rationally know that moving your body is good for you--and will make you feel good--getting started can still be an imposing obstacle.Motivation--specifically, helping people summon the Get-Up-And-Go--is our white whale, our holy grail. Its the thing we think continuously about, and yet its still the part of building a regular training habit that is most challenging for our students. If youre curious to read my deeper thoughts on the topic, click here for the full article. If you wanna get straight to the actionable tips, read on!When I stop to really drill into this question of the best way to get people moving, I run into a pile of big obstacles.First--motivation means different things for different people. The popular notion, the one summarized in countless Nike ads, often involves early mornings, brutal workouts, aggro trainers yelling at you to dig deep, and a virtuous glow after all is said and done.This kind of fits-po (fitness inspiration) makes my skin crawl.Beyond the fact that no one who has ever coached anyone successfully for very long yells at their athletes (coaching is built on trust, and trust is not borne of yelling), the subtle virtue-signaling inherent in these narratives can wreck havoc on our self-esteem and can, if it goes unchecked, totally undermine our ability to exert any sort of control on the direction of our lives.Further, if we buy into the ads, we believe the idea that there is moral virtue at stake when we do (or dont) exercise. This significantly raises the pressure on our decision. After all (according to the ad), our worth as a human, our health, our attractiveness to others can all be decided by our ability or inability to motivate on any given day. This kind of thinking can make the pit of self-hate just too deep to climb out of if/when we fail (because all of us will fail to motivate at some point).This is definitely another reflection of the insidious way diet culture convinces us that feeling shitty about ourselves is our own fault, which it is not. Always remember: it is possible to be happy, healthy and fulfilled at any body size and any level of activity, and your worth as a human is not tied into how strictly you stick with an exercise program, diet, or anything else.And as I mentioned, this cloud of shame can completely undermine our best intentions for ourselves, so getting out from under the oppressive pressures of diet culture must be part of the journey toward having a kick-ass relationship with your body, including the movement of your body.Which brings us back to the confounding question of getting yourself to do the thing, even when you're doing it on YOUR terms. As someone who has motivated to practice music and exercise almost daily for 20+ years, the very experience of being motivated does not (and should not) always require digging deep.In fact, Id say that most of the time (all the time?), motivation feels more like adding that last penny that tips the decision-making scales in favor of doing the thing.Motivation really comes down to a choice that you make many minutes or even hours before you do the thing that really takes motivating. Let me give an example:You are lying in bed, trying to motivate to get up and do your workout. Youve noticed your day goes much better if you can get some movement in early, so you rationally want to do the workout, but you also feel a great resistance.Imagine the decision-making scale in your head (think Greek goddess Athenas scale--not a weight scale), with the not-totally-understood resistance to doing sits on one side, and your more conscious desire to get it done sits on the other.In those quiet moments right after waking, when you still have time to do the thing, this scale can feel stuck, balanced right in the middle. But you also know that if you dont get up soon, your window of opportunity will close and the scales will tip towards inaction.Its this moment that could benefit from motivation. Thats because, while it might seem like the decision is momentous--remember, your very worth as a human can get tied up in this--a small push in either direction and the choice is effectively made.So the question that I encourage you to explore relates to this moment: what tiny action can you take that will tip the scales for you?If, lying in bed, you can decide to put on your favorite sweats and take a big sip of water, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to get up and make coffee, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to just commit to some neck CAR, and that smaller task feels easier, you have tipped the scales.This works because we all rely on previous action to make sense of the next action. Our brains rely on established patterns, or scripts, to follow in getting us from Point A to Point Z; jumping all the in-between steps is too hard.From any of those tiny decisions you make upon waking, the next action flows a little more easily, then the next, and pretty soon you find yourself doing the thing.So today, I have 3 tiny tips for you to try that can make a gigantic difference in tipping the scales in your favor. All of them can be adapted to your situation, and you can implement them immediately.Shrink the ask: just commit to doing the first 5 minutes of the work out/class/whatever. Tell yourself that after the first 5 minutes, if youre still not feeling it, its totally ok to decide that today is not your day. That said, at the end of that first 5-minutes, if you feel good, try 5 more minutes, then check-in again. Alternatively, you can just commit to trying a single exercise, and only moving on if you are feeling good at that point.Stay in this moment: another landmine is to see the days workout as representative of all workouts, or even your worth as a person; maybe you think that if you cant do it today then all your previous work goes out the window (wrong), and/or youll never have the heart to do future workouts if you lose your momentum (also wrong). Just focus on today, right now, and see how those first 5 minutes feel.Bring the challenge closer: in that moment, when you are trying to summon the will-power (or whatever) to do the thing, try to feel out the ways you could imagine actually enjoying the workout. Put on a favorite t-shirt, make yourself a nice glass of iced lemon water, and (most important) put on some excellent music. The research is pretty clear on this last one: music can both elevate your mood AND lower the perceived intensity of a workout. Give yourself a leg-up, and bump the tunes!Have you tried any of these things before? Its truly amazing how well these small mindset shifts can help.As you consider how you might implement these things, Ill leave you with one more thought to ponder: Action always precedes motivation. If you can rouse the energy to do the first (tiny) step, its amazing how your body and mind switch into doing mode.Pretty soon, youre not feeling dead-set against working out, but youre actually (gasp!) enjoying it.Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

      "text": "Heya, it's Coach Will checking in.As I watch the Covid-19 pandemic phenomenon unravel, I keep feeling as if I am witnessing a slow motion (and collective) car accident. Its been utterly disorienting to watch as the tiniest of creatures (a virus) gashes a vast wound--physical and social and economic--across our world.And while I can grasp the stages of recovery involved with healing (or integrating) trauma, I cant yet know how to deal with this one. None of us can, for one reason:its not over yet.We are all suspended in time, oriented only by the fact that we are definitely living inthe time of Covid. And while we can can comprehend the beginning of this epoch, and we are starting to understand the power of simply living for right now ('cuz that's the only option), none of us can say for sure what comes next, even a little bit.But along with everything that's been forced to change, Ive also begun to notice something subtle going on with our clients, something I hadnt expected.And something that is distinctly positive.When we used to train people in person--akaThe Time Before Covid--Hannah and I talked a ton about how tocajoleour peeps into simplydoing the thing. We knew that we had valuable skills to teach them, and that if they showed up some magical things could happen to their bodies, but we kept running into the need toconvincefolks to come train. Toinspirewithout coercion, to invite without the guilt-trip.And that on-going motivating was, and is, an important role. Sometimes, coaches need to be motivators, plain and simple.But I also couldnt help but think the energy that a coach can lend willneverapproach the fire of someone who isintrinsicallymotivated, someone who is curious and dedicated to exploring one simple question: \"What does it feel like to realizemypotential?\"Which brings me back to what Im starting to see blossom in this post-Covid era, even through the narrow communication channels that our new, mostly-digital lives offer...By taking away most of the prompts and prods that we used to be able to offer (eg: classes that you had to sign up and show up for, the energy boost of teammates, the in-the-moment encouragement of coaches, etc), clients have only one person to depend onifthey are going to train at all:themselves.Ironically, this is how it always was...but perhaps it was never quite this clear.The choice to train, to work on your weaknesses and limitations so that you can be stronger and more effective in the future, has always been yours and only yours to make. It's just that our previous \"normal\" livesusedto offer a wide array of distractions from this truth.But with Covid...those stories no longer apply. With so much stripped away, it's just you and thechoice to move, in an epic, daily showdown.Now dont misread me here: Im the first to despair at the temporary loss of in-person connection that our classes and training sessions offered, and I have quite a bit to lose personally if this whole thing continues to careen out of control for much longer.But that doesnt change the powerful stirrings of inner drive that Im noticing in our clients.Im seeing it in their steadily increasing rates of completing workouts (on TrueCoach, our training app) and in their voices during coaching calls. And Im really noticing it in their texted comments and questions; its clear that theyre engaged and intentional and really grabbing on theirownexperience.Theyreshowing up for themselvesin a way that was simply beyond reach for many of thembeforeCovid.And while as a coach Icanmotivate folks, Iliveto light the inner fires that burn much longer for my students than just one workout, one training cycle, or hell, even one pandemic. And I'm seeing some inner fires starting burnbright.Have you noticed stirrings of this morepositivekind inyourresponse to the stress you're facing these days?Have you noticed a shift in yourWhysfor doing things? Or a change in yourexpectations? (Remember, lowered expectations can often mean easier short-term wins that you can then build on.)Have you found yourself, maybe against major inner resistance and lack of any sort ofdrive, digging into the projects or obstacles of your life, and been surprised notonlyby the fact that you have any energy at all, but actually that your efforts feel morereal,orgrounded,or in alignment with your values, then before?Id love to hear about it.Seriously, hit reply and tell me how these times have shifted your inner perspective on doing the hard stuff.Im sure its inspiring as hell,even if you dont think so(its often hardest to see our own heroism).One more thing: while Im stoked to see these threads of gold running through the heart-breaking reality that were all watching--and feeling--unfold out right now, that doesnt undermine the fact that another perfectly normal response is plain ole grief.I believe that tears--real ones and the inner, hidden storm clouds--are the rain that water the little seedlings of our inner lives. We dont get to grow without being vulnerable, and vulnerability means that we sometimes get hurt.So if all youre feeling is hurt, thats ok too (heres a good number to call if youre having trouble navigating this hurt: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)).Either way -- I hope you keep digging away, letting thebounce off, but holding on tight to the gold that you find.Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

    "How to work like an artist": {
      "text": "Its Coach Will dropping in to share some quick thoughts on a topic near and dear to my hear:how--and why--to life gets better if you can see it through the lens of an artist(<---Im hoping you read that with a properly highfallutin accent, like this: Ahhhrteeest :).When I graduated from high school, my brother-in-law sent me a letter that proved to be prophetic.I had attended an arts boarding school for my senior year, rubbing shoulders with the best and brightest performance artistsbeforethey got famous, and was looking ahead to shipping off to conservatory for college.But in the letter, Dillon (my brother-in-law) outlined a paradox of our modern lives: we all love and appreciate art, but dont live in a society that reflects that appreciation with material support for artists and their work.It was somewhat disconcerting to read as a young, aspiring musician (about to embark on 4 years of student-debt accumulation), but it highlighted how important the path Id chosen really was.Art, he said, was so important that it still existedeven thoughour society hadnt figured out how to actually pay most artists, at least not to make their art.His paradox stuck with me, through college and my rocky post-college years, when it became clear that I wasnt very interested in figuring out how to actually make a living playing my trumpet--mostly because being a gigging trumpet player didnt involve much art-making after all.I turned instead to the fitness biz, where my natural interest in physicality, self-determination, and helping people came together (and paid the bills).And it allowed me time to keep playing music, to keep working on my art, and to keep digging on the question Dillon had raised for me:whydoesart matter, after all?Oddly, the answer came to menotthrough music, but through building The Fitness Alchemists.As Hannah and I combed through the needs of our students--past and present--and investigated how we might use the tools of fitness to help address them, I realized that the struggle of artists is really the struggle that all of us engage with:How do we make our imaginationreal?How do we make the things that we imagine? How do we translate dreams into reality? How do we process the pain and wrongs of our past into richer and better futures?Those questions are as important for the artist as they are for the engineer, the school teacher, and the personal trainer. For all of us, the struggle we face in crafting satisfying lives is in finding the right balance oftechnique and imagination.Imaginationis the fertile, fecund ground of our minds that fixates on compelling observations and draws creative connections. It is where our dreams about the future come from, and the source of the belief that change ispossible.But that imagination stays bottled-up, private, and formless until we can make itreal. Unless we have thetechniqueto translate our ideas into something that we can share with fellow humans, our ideas never get tohappen. Technique is the skill that we have with the tools that we have.What that technique consists of exactly will be different for each of us--just like our imaginations will be highly individual--but our ability to translate imagination into reality often comes down to a simple but unavoidable need forenoughtechnique.I slowly realized that for all the people we worked with through the Fitness Alchemists, no matter their goals or obstacles, they would besunkif they couldnt balance theimagination/technique equationfortheirbodies.Sometimes they had felt limited--by pain, or time, or cultural norms--that they didnt have any imagination for their physical selves anymore. For these folks, often just finding movement that felt goodandresulted in tangible changes to their physical abilities (over time) was enough to light the imaginative fire. A little work on theirtechniqueopened the door for theirimaginationto bloom.For others, who already had a rich physicalimagination, small improvements in their physical tools--their movementtechnique--unlocked profound shifts in bringing their imagination to life.But for everyone--me and Hannah included--progress requires therightcombination of imagination and technique, in our work lives but also in our physical lives. After all, we are physical beings before we are anything else.Like artists, we all must engage with the struggle of having ideas (imagination) and making those ideas real (technique), even andespeciallyin the realm of our bodies.Im curious...when it comes to your physical life, how doyounavigate this equation?Do you feel limited in yourimaginationof your physical self?Or do you struggle with bringing that imagination to life, because you feel limited by yourtechnique?No matter what your challenge is, the world really needs whatever you have locked inside.To finding your gold,Coach WillPS: if youre curious what this equation looks like formethese days, at least when it comes to my actual music-making, Id love to have you join me on Facebook Live tonight (Saturday) for a balcony jazz concert for our neighbors--and YOU--with my love (and masterful flutist), Debbie. Well be posting the live onThe Fitness Alchemists Facebook page.",

    "The Start Over Button": {
      "text": "Heya, and welcome to your weekend....Today, I want to share a tool that has had an outsize impact for me (Coach Will): theStart Over Button.Very simply, this is the mental switch that allows us to begin again, to leave the paralysis, anxiety, turmoil, etc. we might feel behind for the moment, and invite anewexperience, unencumbered by all that weight and pressure.Before I really understood this mental reset, I figured it was just a little trick that didnt really change my reality. But it is in fact an age-old tool--familiar to meditators the world over--to circumvent suffering, and the power of this tool compounds with practice.Before I dive in, though, I need to acknowledge that this Start Over mindset switch is not always possible, and it would be callous and ignorant for me to pretend that it is. In fact, it is a significant privilege of mine that I have had the freedom to practice this ability to press reset.This is a privilege born of my inherited status, my whiteness, my relative wealth, my male-ness, my youth, my thinness and my non-disability.When I take a steady look at myself, I see someone who enjoys many of the things that make lifeeasierin this society, many of the parts thatobscurewhat society actually is for many, many people. In fact, it obscures what it feels like and what it offers formost people.Im not ignorant to these privileges persay, because I can learn about them, name them, and look for their impact. But my inability toseereality clearly is shaped by the fact that I simply dont need to confront the obstacles that so many other people do.Which brings me back to this special tool that I have been able to hone through my years of spacious privilege:the Start Over Button. By allowing a momentary respite from the noise in my head, this reset switch has offered me clarity--something particularly valuable during this historically fucked-up time. And this clarity has helped me see my privilege, my gaps in experience, and what I might be able to do about all of it.I first heard about the Start Over Button from my trumpet professor in college. We used to meet once a week in the tiny practice rooms high up in the decrepit old Boston office buildings that housed my conservatory (I was a music performance major in college).Sitting there, our knees almost touching, Id pour my soul out each week. Between playing a few short bars--which had been the focus of hours of practice the previous week--and talking about self-worth, ambition, anxiety, etc, I bared my soul to that guy more than just about anyone Ive ever known.He would hold space for all of it, and worked every week to give me new ways of seeing problems. He was continuously trying to help me understand myself in a way that I coulduseto change my trajectory. Looking back, I realize that he taught me most about accessing my inner power; the music was a far second.And theStart Over buttonwas one of his favorite tools.Between snippets of my playing, when hed notice me beginning to struggle, hed lean in and say, Ok, nowblue sky it...press that reset button, and hed press an imaginary button right above my knee cap.With that, hed demonstrate what he wanted: hed shake out his shoulders and neck, take a big, easy breath, blink his eyes wide, and settle back into his chair with a pleasant smile. Hed reset.His reset was so powerful, so purely cleansing for him that I, an eager-to-please, ball-of-nerves undergrad, felt the impact by osmosis. Id lose a bit of my tension, stop gripping my experience quite so hard, and settle into the present moment.Those fleeting windows of clarity didnt do much for my playing in college--I never could really bring that kind of ease to my music-making back then; I cared about it all a little too much.But the Start Over button stuck. I found myself using it more and more after college, to stay calm in a domestic spat, while I was waiting in a too-long line, or during a tough work meeting.And the more that I practiced using it, the simpler it got. Even just thinking about a blue sky will get me to take a short moment to breathe slowly in, and then let the air fall easily out. To sit back, and notice my experience.These moments of interrupt have played an especially big role in my self-care these last couple weeks as our country reels. As the news of yet another tragic chapter of black people losing their lives at the hands of a systematically oppressive society, while a global epidemic continues to grip us all, Ive found myself struggling to know what to think and what to do.But in these unchartered waters, when Im not sure of much at all, Imsurethat my Start Over moments are saving me. For a minute or so at a time, I can separate the smothering weight of before from the present moment. And then I can move forward, and take actions that feel true.However you find that you are able to open up these moments for yourself, Id encourage you to try. It may not last for long, or even be possible in that moment, butyou deserve access to the calm and decisiveness ofyourinner power--we all do.Whatever youre doing these days to take care of yourself and your loved ones, I see your efforts, and applaud you for them.Sending love to you,Coach Will",

    "Am I doing this right?": {
      "text": "Hey,Probably the question i have been asked most often in my fitness coaching career is:\"Am I doing this right?\"There is only ONE (worthwhile)answer to this question. And that is:\"Itdepends!\"Super annoying answer, I know, especially for those of us whocrave certainty (heyyyy I have that cravingtoo! Coach Hannah, here)But heres the real real : exercise is a made-up thing that humans invented.Any exercise you can think of fits this bill: Squats, lunges, pushups, pull ups, shoulder CARs, hip CARs, etcThey are all invented devices, designed to help the bodyadaptin a desired way.Which means that theanswer to the question: AM I DOING THIS (exercise) RIGHT? Depends on a deeper and more personal question:howdo you want your body to adapt?That's the kernel at the center of it all.Some questions that are helpful as you unpack this answer:is there something youd like to be able to DO, that you are unable to do now? (For example: walk up the stairs without clutching the railing, run for 20mins without stopping, lift and move heavy boxes for a full day without a back ache that night.)is there a way youd like to FEEL physically, that is different than how you feel now? (Id like to feel less tired and more energized, less fragile and more powerful, less stiff and more fluid)**A side note worth mentioning here (also a topic that deserves its own email):The more relevant these desired adaptations are to your actual day-to-day life, the easier it will be to carve out time to do the exercises that will help you adapt in those directions.(this is why we made a library of Kinstretch classes available to our members, so that as each person gets clear on how they want to adapt, there's an option to select the classes that pertain to those specific joints or body parts)**Once you identify the adaptations that are meaningful to you, then we can filter further and get clear on whether the exercise is being performed in such a way that it supports your desires!Let's say the desire is for morestrength.When I am in session with a client and this question comes up, I usually answer it with more questions:what do you feel working (or engaging) when you do this movement?(this will help us identify if we are training the specific muscleswe want to make stronger)is there any pain or feeling of \"I'm not safe\"?(for the nervous system to gain confidence aka the precursor to strengthin uncharted territory, it needs to feel safe/pain free. Challenged?yes--painful/unsafe? no)Which will then lead us to any adjustments that need to be made.The biggest pitfall to buying into this idea that exercise can be done RIGHT or WRONG, is that we might opt to do nothingfor fear of doing it wrong.I view my role as a coach not to be the keeper of RIGHT and WRONG stickers to be smacked upon the foreheads of my students, but rather to give you the tools you need to feel jazzed about experimentation. The confidence to ask great questions that will lead to even better questions.I said it last week, and Imma say it again:Changeis brought about bymany consistent efforts over a long period of time.Keep asking, keep moving, keep centering your practice around your desires.Here's your community Kinstretch class for the week:Thoracic Spine + Breathinga delicious chance to explore how your spine moves with feedback from being near a wall. I would LOVE to hear your questions - please hit reply and ask after you try it!To our resilience,Hannah",

    "(Actually) Upgrade Yo'self!": {
      "text": "If youre going to understand one concept about how to train your body this year, I want you learn this one:the difference between external and internal training.Hey--its Coach Will, and this is one of those nerd-tastic topics that I feelverystrongly about.Isowant you to learn this difference because knowing it willset you free: free from the unhelpful pressures of media, free from the down-right dangerous bro-science that thrives at most gyms, and free from the many, many myths that get internalized about what we should be doing when we work out.These two broad categories--of internal and external training are defined bywhatyou are trying to change when you train.For external training, you are trying to change somethingoutside--how much weight you can lift, how high you can jump, how far you can run, etc. The key here is that these are ways that you (and other people!) cansee.For internal training, you are aiming to change somethinginside--the quality of some specific tissues, how much room a certain joint has to work, how strong you are at a specific position, etc.Now, at first glance,mostpeople think that training is the use ofexternal trainingin order to changeinternal variables(eg: Im going to squat to increase my leg muscles). Most people think thats just whattraining is.But thats not quite right. And there is another way (which Ill get to).To some extent, its true that you are having an effect on your internal environment (the world of muscles, bones, blood, etc) when you use external training. BUT (and its a big but), very oftenthe internal variable thats actually being prompted to change with that external training isnotthe internal variable that you are intending to change.In the world of external training, the tissues of your body are nobly trying to accomplish whatever task your brain is aiming at; the function of the inside stuff is all secondary to the external, brain-directed goal. That means that the squat, which you have chosen because of how it affects your leg muscles,actuallydrives a much more significant change to your nervous system (Learn how to do this movement!!) then to those leg muscles.Trying to improve the function of your leg stuff with a squat is sort of like trying to paint an intricate sculpture with a paint roller; sure, youll get paint on the thing, but only on the parts that stick out. All the little crevices, the hard-to-reach spots, wont get any paint at all.And if--as is the case for almost every single person Ive ever worked with--some of those tissues thatshouldbe involved when you squat (some of your leg stuff) arenot up to the task(because they dont contract well, or they arent controlled well by your brain, etc), your body subconsciously and automatically tries to make-up for them, to work around them, by over-burdening the neighboring tissue thatisup to the task. Thats whats going on for most over-use injuries, everywhere on your body.And its that making-up-for that leads to the all-too-common story of external training causing more pain/damage than benefit. What a bummer: that squat didnt maWhile you may have picked that squat because of how its theoretically a whole-body exercise, the actual squat is just more training for the part of your body thatalready know how to work. The other parts of your leg, the parts that desperately need to be trained so that theycanbe part of your movement abilities, stay dormant.If, on the other hand, we focus explicitly on the internal variable (the internal changes youre after), we will usually end up with an exercise that looks very different from a squat--different from any named exercise, in fact.Wed end up with an exercise that is as unique as your leg. Wed end up with an exercise perfectly tailored to the goal of getting the muscle tissue in your leg to WAKE UP and get to its work of creating and resisting force.And with that tissue added to the whole complex that makes up your active leg stuff, you get better at squatting (oranything else you might want to do). The loads and demands of complex movement are spread out to more tissue, lowering the chance of injuryandincreasing the total output.Yes, Im basically saying the opposite of what so many of us have been led to believe: by letting go of the external training measure (eg squat) so that we can focus onactually training the internal capability, you get better at the external measure. Said a different way,if the parts that make up the whole are improved, you cant help but improve the whole.Which begs one more question: why do any external training at all? Its a good question.If youre a pro athlete whossportinvolves an external variable--like how much you squat (powerlifting), or high you jump (track/field)--then you should definitely practice that specific skill.Or if you get a social or competitive need met by really going after a certain skill or skill-set (playing a team-sport, competing in a martial art, entering races), then you should probably practice those skills.On the other hand, if youre just doing those movements because thats all you know, or you saw some muscley human doing them, or some other reason that does NOT relate to your actual needs, then consider hitting the pause button (onthosemovements).If your purposes are general fitness aka get healthy aka I feel better when Im active, then you need to spend time and effort on changingthosevariables, and not some external measure. If you want to train to make your insides better, focus on improving those components specifically--yourleg stuff,yourshoulder range-of-motion,yourcardiorespiratory system--anddontjust practice skills.This is part of why Im so passionate about changing the fitness narrative. For all that I hear about how little time people have to train, I want to make sure that whatdoes get trainedis going to be impactful and intentional.So now that youre armed with this knowledge, Id encourage you to use this lense on your current training what are you training when you work out? Are you explicitly working on affecting your insides, or are you sweating after external goals? And if you are, why?Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

    "Exposing My Practice": {
      "text": "My personal fitness practice is where the rubber meets the road, where theory first comes into practice. And to be honest, much of what I now guide people to do is the result of heavy self-study over the past couple decades.What Ive come to realize is that because of how ourbrainschange, the majority of our training effort should go into the aspects of fitness that lay the physical groundwork and set us up for the peak-level efforts that we all usually associate with working out.Im reminded here of one my favorite quotes: Dont study something. Get used to it. (Japanese proverb).When we go about trying to learn something--anything--our brains prioritize the knowledge that is emotionally stimulating. Thats why well often remember all the tiniest details of both the happiest moments of our lives, as well as the traumatic ones.But this emotion also warps our sense of reality (detailed memory is notoriously unreliable). So when we want to reallyknowsomething, to approach anunderstandingof something--especially a complex thing like theneeds of our bodies--we need to work with and alongside our emotional realities through a consistent (usually daily) practice of some kind. Having that kind of regularity is the only opportunity we have to find that most-valuable ingredient: perspective.If its important, do it everyday, says one of my favorite coach-philosophers, Dan John.When I finally learned that--really got it into my bones--my personal fitness approach changed in a subtle but profound way. I was finally able to let go of the sense that exercise was something I should do a certain way.The only thing I should do was the important work ofknowing myself.Practically speaking, that meant a major shift to make the regular, daily work of taking my joints through controlled, end-range circles (CARs) a major component of my physical practice (and what I guide all of our trainees toward). Im talking here about small but persistent doses of movement (10-15 min every damn day) that provide an all-important basis for any other physical activity. Its the slow-drip pressure that, like the water that shaped the Grand Canyon, slowly yields the big changes.On that foundation, I then spend another regular portion of time (20-30min, 4-5x per week) working on the weak points of my mobility. That is, I stretch and contract andlearnto control the parts of my body that are not fully fluent; basically, I do Kinstretch. This is a slow process, but averyspecifically-targeted one that gradually shifts over time, with the actual stretches and exercises Im using evolving to reflect the most deficit joints. There is nothing random about this investment of training time. With time and effort and--most importantly--on-going awareness of progress (because of the daily CARs), I move through and beyond my mobility issues.A back tweak will bring specific spinal work into the rotation for a month; a sore elbow will demand a few sets focusing on elbow control. My chronically jacked R hip will request on-going nursing, but will also slowly unlock more and more possibilities for movement as it gains resiliency and range.Which brings me to the final component of my regular fitness routine: high-intensity practice. This is the part of training that dominated my understanding of working-out since I was 13, when I was training exclusively so I could see a six-pack. At that time (from what I read on the internet) it seemed that lifting weights, at mostly high-intensities, 3-5 times a week,would make all my dreams come true.And in some ways, this kind of habitisa marker of longevity and physical satisfaction in humans: beingstrongand beingwelloften go hand in hand (as does weakness and being unwell). But the confusing piece, and what threw me for a loop in my teens and early twenties, was thatthe body you bringto the exercise matters much more than the exercise or program.That is, the function of each joint (i.e. does it function?), the effectiveness of your cardiovascular system, and your health status (are you diseased, injured, etc?) will be determining factors in if fitness works for you or not. Often,working out intensely to change these basic qualities is putting the cart before the horse.So what finally shifted for me was a change in priority. Rather than fixating on the peaks of my best training days, I became much more engaged with the basic function of my body:Is it rested?Does it move, in some way, many times a day?Is it provided with adequate fuel (caloric, psychological, spiritual)?I found, through trial-and-error, that I had to ask--and resolve--these basic questionsevery day.When those baselines were met (mostly through daily movement dose of CARs, and upping my sleep), I was ready to actually address my limitations, which came in the form of regular, targeted Kinstretch.Only then, when the groundwork had been properly laid, was I able to extract the true benefit of more intense exercise. Now, rather than dragging myself through intense workouts (that often felttoohard), my body is prepped and ready when I decide to go more intensely, which happens 2-4 times per week for an hour or so (or, if Im riding my bike, much longer).And because that work is more intense, it drives adaptations to my body much more effectively when I was justplayingat intensity (but not actually able to work that hard).I will often visualize this blend of inputs for clients this way:          What I hope is obvious here is that the work you put into maintaining basic function serves as the foundation of the pyramid that supports anything else youd like to do with your body.Giving that maintenance step short-shrift is a recipe for frustration; on the other hand, giving that daily part its due--as hum-drum and unsexy as it is--sets you up forwhateverelse you can dream up.Whether your a stalwart in the physical training game, or just dipping a toe in, I hope theres something here for you to take away. At the end of the day, changing our bodies is first and foremost alearning process.Happy discovering!Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

    "become a badass at being bad (at things)": {
      "text": "While talking with a new client last week, she shared that she has never gotten into a groove of exercising.She'stried personal training, kettle bell classes, gyms, but nothingstuck. Other than getting exercise via biking to get places.She wisely identified that a major barrier in all of these experiences was how uncomfortable it was to feel like she wasbad at exercising.Especially compared to her peers in the classes she was taking at the time.I can totally relate to this  can you?Ill be honest I dont like being bad at things. My general tolerance for being a beginner is pretty low. Which is another way to say: I have very high expectations of myself.Much to my personal chagrin, learning a new skill, or developing a new habit, means that at first, we have to do it badly. Awkwardly. Clumsily.And that is super uncomfortable.More often than not, the amount of time it takes to get better at something is longer than our tolerance (or attention span) for being uncomfortable.And so, we quit. We say, yeah I tried that but its just not for me.This is something a lot of people struggle with, but few are able to articulate.(BTW, I congratulated this client for having such keen self-awareness  thats a big frickin deal!)So how do we work with this stumbling block?How do we become a badass at being bad at things?I dont have any quick fixes for this issue  I wish I did! But it is something I have worked with a lot in myself, and with clients.Heres what Ive found to be most helpful:Let it be hardName and acknowledge that one of the hardest parts of learning any new skill is tolerating the exquisite discomfort of being bad at it as we are first learning.I think if enough of us do this out loud, we might be able to create a cultural shift that supports us to be kinder to ourselves during that uncomfortable phase.Reframe the goalWhen starting a new thing, rather than asking: How quickly can I get back to being comfortable & competent?Try:Can I use this practice to increase my tolerance for discomfort?If we know that learning any new thing is going to require discomfort, then it seems pretty worthwhile to get better at being ok with being uncomfortable. And if we can learn how tolearn, we are making a potent investment in ourselves that will have an incredible ripple effect over our lifetime.Lower the stakesThe other big piece that helps me when Im hitting a wall is to take some time to investigate if Im coupling myworth as a humanwith mycompetency at [fill in the blank]Thems some high stakes! Its real hard to be playful, curious, and forgiving of clumsiness & outright mistakes when it feels like your intrinsic worth is on the line.Heres a little exercise I use in my journal when I realize these two things are getting tangled.I am a valuable human. I am not great at ______________________I will still be valuable whether or not I get better at __________________Id like to get better at ____________________ because it will enrich my life in the following ways _____________________________Get the right supportHaving the right support from an empathetic coach makes a HUGE difference.Knowing you arent the only one struggling with this is also a big help.Connecting with community and hearing that folks you admire stumble over the same roadblocks helps.Hence why I wanted to write this :)One of the things that I love/hate about Kinstretch is that it involves end-range training. Because muscles are weakest at end range, training there feels like being a bad at it beginner ALL THE TIME.Heres achance to expand your tolerance for discomfort, via our weekly community Kinstretch class:Kinstretch: Hip Internal RotationAnd Im curious:Do you dislike being bad at things?Do you hold yourself to a precipitously high standard?How do you work with the discomfort of being an awkward beginner?Let's talk about it.To our resilience,HannahP.S.

We are learning more every day how to address this toxic storyline, even as we continue to be struck by just how often it pops up.But another part of bucking old norms is also embracing new ones. Without alternative guide-posts to navigate by, its just too easy to fall into the same old trap of training so thatother people accept your body.Remember: in our view, the only person who should have sovereignty and control over your body isyou.So today Im hoping to map out one of those new norms, and its a juicy one:daily practice.Now before you get your eyes stuck rolling them all the way around (Im not here for any pseudo-spiritual practice BS Will!), Ill share one fact with you:movement is how your body maintains itself.For example, movement is the way that lymph (the carrier for your healing/guardian white-blood cells) moves around your body, as there is no central pump to help it move. In contrast, your blood gets pushed around your body by your heart, although even then it needs some help from your muscles to pump the blood back from your extremities (which is why hospitals will put mechanical calf-massagers on bed-ridden clients during extended stays).And thats just the tip of the ice-berg.Since our bodies are in a continuous state of rebuilding, with special cells running around laying down new tissue and breaking down old tissue, continuous movement is always happening on a micro level.But the only way those cells know whatkindof tissue to make is by the physical forces they receive, mostly through the large movements we make with our bodies. A hamstring stretch (like when you reach for your toes) signals those special cells to make stretch-able tissue in the back of your leg; a tough hike that gets you huffing and puffing signals those cells to repair and build-up cells in your heart and lungs.Withoutthose signals, those cells dont know what youd like them to make.Over time, those cells become less and less active, your natural self-building and self-healing processes slow, and that ever-present tendency toward disorder--entropy--takes over.So whether wed like to reverse this courseorcontinue prompting our body to become even stronger, more resilient, more expressive, morewhatever, were going to need to use movement to send that signal.Which gets me back to the significance of daily-ish practice (I say -ish because you dont get any extra gold stars for aperfect daily record). When you get into the habit of sending a smallbut persistentsignal to your tissue two incredible things happen:Your body truly receives the signal youre trying to send. Consider back pain, something that 80% of us will experience in our lifetime. A massage, an adjustment, or an acupuncture treatment might be a clear enough signal to change your present situation (and allay the presence of current pain), but it is certainlynotenoughsignal to change the dynamics of whatever caused your back pain in the first place. Only regular inputs--at least daily--have a shot at telling your cells todo something different.You learn new things, and make different (unconscious) choices. While there is a significant effect that movement has on the meat-and-bone tissue, your brain is also highly impacted by physical movement in that our brain makes choices about what ispossiblefor our bodies based on the movements we practice. We can shape the working map that our brain has of our body simply by moving in regular, consistent doses. And armed with an upgraded map, our brain makes different choices all day long to more effectively carry us through the world; even a slight shift in posture might be the difference between debilitating back pain, and none at all.All of this--and much more--is whats at stake when we propose a daily practice.And rather than being something youshoulddo, yet another stressor or shame-trap coming from Diet Culture, this proposal is one that gives you a little more personal power every day.Its a way to begin directingyourphysical process, to take control of that process, and receive the fruits of that process.And--perhaps most importantly--its a daily way to undermine theothersignals we might experience from the media, friends/family, and everywhere else, telling us what weshoulddo.Last thing... Ill have you notice that I havent spelled out herewhatto do with that daily practice, and thats not because I dont have an opinion (ask my girlfriend, shell tell you I have an opinion about everything ;). No, I left that part out because way more important thanwhatyou do with your daily movement time is that you actually move everyday.Most of the time I will write to you about ways to move, how to movebetterordifferently, but today I simply want you torememberto move.Please: in whatever way that feels right, go honor that life-affirming capacity that you have to relocate your bones, to flush your blood, to explore the space that holds you.The bottom line is that thereisa way to think about changing your body without getting tripped up by what other people think your body should look like. And it all starts with regularly engaging your body in conversation. It starts with a daily-ish practice.Go be your own hero!Coach WillPS to those of you NOT currently training with: This day-by-day process toward building self-sovereignty is the meat-and-potatoes of what we teach; the actual movement coaching iseasyin comparison to getting into an effective dialogue with your body.

      "text": "Hey,Hope you're ready for a soapbox moment, cuz I am right up on one tuh-DAY. (Coach Hannah, here)Im in thisfacebook group full of fitness professionals who want to make their own mobility better via Kinstretch.The other day, this dude posted a video of him doing a segmental Cat/Cow and asked the group for some feedback and suggestions.I have zero ability to flex my lower back. Been doing it for over a month maybe 30 min a dayyea Im terrible and that section doesnt move. Any suggestions welcomeTo translate: He is working on getting his low back to be able to make a round shape (lumbar flexion)......but was starting to wonder if he was a lost cause as he didnt seeany improvement after a months worth of daily work.Then he went on to share that hed had 3 disc herniations and had spent his life trying to maintain a neutral spine. (i.e. a slight arch in his low back  the opposite of what he is training for now)Ah, there it is.Y'all: When you compare amonth of workto move yourself in ONE direction to alifetime of worktrying NOT to move in that direction, which one wins?I chimed in on the thread to say: \"You're not a lost cause, tissue can always change, but it might take more time than you think. Stick with it, give it more time.\"This exchange reminded me that there are VERY few places on the internet where people are deeply honest about what it will take to change your body.Mostof the fitness (and even mobility) marketing I see out thereleans into our very human desire to get guaranteed results in a set amount of time.I understand the temptation.Get ___________ in 12 weeks with our proven system!will get more clicks than:Physiological changes take tiiiiiiiiiiiiiime.How much time?We dont know. Each human being responds differently to training.But that is the only honest answer.Lasting physical changes to the body are going to need auniquebalance of training (applied stress) and recovery (rest, de-stress, nourishment) for everysingleperson.If trainersbend that truth in order to sell their programming, the result is a culturethatsets our clientsup to fail.Its time for a sea-change.If we really want to help people change...We need to normalize realistic improvements, achieved over realistic timelines.We need to celebrate striving to be just 1% better.We need to glorify staying committed to the process, and finding joy in our daily work.We need to be kind to ourselves when we fall off the wagon, and lovingly help ourselves get back on.These are the values that Will and I center our practice around.We are definitely swimming against the tide, but I'm here for it, and if you're still reading this, maybe you are too.Take your time. Enjoy the ride. Tune in and notice the smallest changes.Cheers,Hannah",

    "build a smarter heart": {
      "text": "Every once in a while, its a good idea to have a moment of gratitude for our most abstracted* organ: our humble heart.That thing just works and works, valiantly pumping oxygen- and nutrition-infused blood all over our body. It reacts instantaneously to the shifting demands we place on it, and--most of the time--never takes a break.But seeing it merely as a pump misses some its magnificence, and obscures the ways in which it (likeallthe other tissue in our body) isconstantlyresponding to stimuli and adapting accordingly.If we make the mistake of seeing our heart (or any other part of our body) as afixed, unchangingthing, we risk letting it whither slowly into dysfunction while we undermine its incredible ability to transform.So. While its possible to get lost in the incredible minutiae of how our hearts work (trust me--I have, and its a deep, dark Google-hole), Id encourage each and every one of you to read and process what Im about to describe about your cardiac muscle. I promise it will take about 5 min to read AND youll finish knowing whatyoucan do to properly honor that heart of yours.Our hearts are responsible for one main job: sending spent blood to the lungs (to get reloaded with oxygen) and then sending that newly oxygenated blood all over our bodies. That double pump that you feel/hear when you check your pulse is each of those separate-but-related jobs happening in quick succession.But if we zoom in on what needs to occur for blood to get sent around, well see that the heart is actually engaged in a precise dance back and forth that requires both flexibilityandstrength: first, the heart must expand as it fills with blood, andthenit contracts to forcefully send that blood wherever its headed.So that means thatright afteryou hear/feel your heartbeat (the blood going out of your heart), your heart is actuallyrelaxedandstretchingto take in new blood. Or it should be.The problem is thatthatsthe piece of training our hearts that usually gets skipped.For most people, when they think of doing cardio they think of the hard work that the heart does to actually pump the blood. Which is why they assume that getting your heart to pump fastermustbe better. Right?Wrong! When the only way that you train your heart is to get it to beat faster and pump bloodoutwith more force, you skip over the valuable chance to teach your heart to expand fully and fill with more blood.This is why we continuously guide people to do the majority of their cardio training at a more moderate pace (Zone 2, or 60-70% of your Heart Rate Reserve*), so that they can start training both functions of their hearts--the pumpingandthe stretching.This kind of training is not the kind that will leave you gasping and writhing on the floor after only a few minutes. In fact, we often describe the pace youll want to find as conversational--as in, you should be able to have a breathless conversation with a friend while you do it.But by improving the function of your heart as a muscle that expandsandcontracts, this kind of trainingwillset you up for all those more intense levels of output that you might want to train or play with.Now heres the kicker: Zone 2 training takestime, and there just arent any short-cuts. (Remember, a main part of what were training is thetimethat your heart spends in a stretch, while its expanding.)Which is why any strategies you can find tohelpyou hang out in that Zone 2 and actually--gasp!--enjoy it are good-as-gold. So download some great podcasts, pick a beautiful route, and try out a fewdifferentmovement options (ie jogging, hiking, biking, rowing, etc.... and heres a hint: go for the ones you enjoy but ALSO the ones that are most convenient).Basically, do what you can to make it suck as little as possible to start, and the endorphins you find at the end will do the rest.Ill offer just one more strategy the most useful thingIve foundis to build a little community and intrinsic accountability around my training (somehow, my motivation is significantly impacted whenother people see it--which probably says something about me). Considering current shelter-in-place demands, that means we must look online for this too, but luckily weve found just the ticket withStrava.Several of you jumped on board with this app when I first introd it a couple months back, and wed love to have more of you; we even have aTFA groupyou can join once you set up your profile. Wed love to have you join us.However you do it, I really hope you make some time to train your ticker!Go be your own hero,Coach Will*WHY must hearts always be portrayed like a butt-triangle?? I think the actual thing is a pretty cool shape...**Check out this articleon how to figure out your Heart Rate ReserveImage note: image is from Oakland School of the Art's 2019 Spring Benefit fundraiser event, accessed viahttps://thefoxoakland.com/events/osa-presents-heart-oakland(7/14/20)",

      "text": "Does this sound familiar?\"I'm going to workout for an hour today!\"...time passes...\"Oh crap, I only have 15mins in which to workout. Eff it, I'll just push my workout until tomorrow\"Tomorrow comes: Same conversation repeats.Weeks go by.Same conversation, same amount of time spent working out (0mins).Now, let's replay that scenario with a different script:\"I'm going to spend some dedicated time moving my body today -- ideally a whole delicious hour!\"...time passes..Oh crap, I only have 15mins left of that hour I planned to spend working out. Oh well, Im still gonna use it to move![exercises for 15mins]Repeat same conversation +action every day for 4 weeksAt the end of the month, total time spent exercising?420 minutes aka 7 hrs!As a recovering perfectionist myself, I know this story so well.Its SO tempting for me to skip doing something, if I feel like I cant do it perfectly (the wayId planned and imagined.)Here's a framing that helps me get out of this trap.Think of every minute you are able to spend moving your body as $1 you are putting into a savings account.5 mins doing CARs? That's $5 going into that account.Whatever story I might be telling myself, the numbers don't lie:15mins today = 15 mins (aka $15)vs0 mins today (+ the intention to do 60minstomorrow) = 0 mins (aka $0)Each day, do what you can with the time that you have.Give yourself permission to do half of that Kinstretch class, or only 3 sets of the Capacity workout instead of 5, or to go for a 10 minute walk on your lunch break if that is whatyou have the mental spoons for today.If you're a numbers person, you can keep a simple tally of the time you spend moving each day.You'll be surprised how much it adds up to over time.Here to doing \"not enough\", more often :)-Hannah",

    "but what if I do it wrong?": {
      "text": "Hey,Last week we talked about the question I have been asked THE MOSTin my coaching career:\"Am Idoing this right?\"Today, I want to talk to you about ONE type ofexercise that you cannot do wrong.(Coach Hannah here, what's uuuuppp?)Confession: I used to lean into the idea of Right & Wrong ways of moving and think that my value as a personal trainer was to help my clients do things \"correctly\" so that they wouldn't hurt themselves.Then I went to the FRC seminar and that idea was shattered to smithereens. (<--- we don't use this ridiculous word enough, please feel free to help me put it back into circulation so that the millennials can enjoy it too.) #oldtimeyslangFTWThe latest research is showing thethere is no such thing as a perfect movement.Let's take the squat.I used to think that there was a stored movement pattern called \"squat\" that wecould learn and hone until it'sthe sameevery time we do it.Nope. The research actually shows thatthe oppositeis true.The more advanced/skilled the athlete becomes,the morevarietywill show up in how the body & nervous system execute the movement task, or what you and I would call \"The Squat.\"This blew my mind when I heard it.I was like, what whaaaaat? But I've been practicing and practicing in order to achieve repeatable perfection! You're messing with my plan, man!(insert small tantrum here.)But yeah. The research is clear.The nervous system works way faster behind the scenes than our conscious logical mind ever could. You might THINK you are controlling your \"perfect\" squat form with your thoughts, but you're just... not.So if we can't rehearse for perfection, what CAN we do?We can expand ouroptionsWe can upgrade the quality of our partsWe can improve the communication & trust between ourbody(muscles, ligaments, joints) andourcentral command(nervous system).This is what Kinstretch is allllll about.Which brings me to The Exercise That Cannot Be Done Wrong: The C.A.R.Let's break this term down for a minute, because almost every time I teach CARs, somebody goes, \"what does CARs stand for?\" So here ya go... Controlledmeans you are moving smoothly under tension, not just flopping around. Another way to think about this is: no momentum, no help from gravity. How would you move if the air were dense - likewet cement? This control is super important! It is what sends info about that joint back to your central command, so it can learn, and in turn, adapt. Making you more resilient for next time. Articularmeaning, relating to a joint. And not the kind that is nowlegal in the state of California. We are talking about the major joints of the body: hips, shoulders, knees, elbows, and the connection of all 26 vertebrae in your spine, to name a few. There are more, but I'm trying to keep your attention, so we will move on :) Rotationas in, a big ol' circle.You want to take each joint through it's full (pain-free) range of motionevery day.Cuz here's the deal, friends.Movement capabilityis expensive to maintain.If you aren't regularly using a particular range of motion, your body goes, oh, s/he's not using that road, let's stop maintaining it. Guess what happensthe next time you try to use that road? You run into a big-ass detour sign (aka pain or injury).We get the optimal benefit if we doCARsevery day.This is why we include CARs in every Fitness Alchemists' class & private session.This is why it'sthe first thing we teach our new clients (and The Number One thing we urge folks to do on their own.)But often we get asked: BUT WHAT IF I DO THEM WRONG?I've got great news for ya: When it comes to CARs, thereis no WRONG.As long as it's pain free, it is better to do whatever you can remember of your CARs (imperfect, kinda awkward, however it feels) than to do nothing.Nothing gets you nothing. The nervous system gets sent to bed without supper.Something gets yousomething. Even a shitty CAR gives the nervous system some morsel to chew on.So go forit!We madethis videoto lead you through the daily CARs routine, in case you need some guidance & accountability. It's free.If you haven't started doing daily CARs yet,or if youve recently fallen out of the habit, treat yourself to this 15minute daily practice.Kick right & wrong to the curb and just do your best.In keeping with our CARs theme, this weeks Community Kinstretch class is aCapsule CARs Circuit. This class has been very popular with our members. It takes the rotational benefits of traditional CARs, and zooms in on the deepest layer of tissue supporting each joint aka \"the capsule.\" Next week we will talkmore about why training this deep stuff matter so much, but I'd like you to feel it first.Enjoy!To your resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "The more I have learned about the human body, the more I am amazed that all of us dont just crumple and collapse with the slightest breeze. (Coach Will here)I dont get this sense because of how fragile we are--we areclearlynot--but because of how interconnected andcomplexthe human body is. So many components that are essential for baseline health depend on so many other components, which themselves are dependent on other components, and so on.Each stage is super complex unto itself, little puzzles of biochemistry and cellular communication that need to workjuuuusstright. To think that these hundreds of separate phenomenon actually coexist and thrive in sequence is not just implausible, its miraculous.This chain of dependence means that a process that breaks down anywhere along the line would be catastrophic, andyet that rarely happens. Most of us, most of the time, manage the variations of our lives just fine, and our complex body systems just accept the novelty and carry on.So... how do we do it?Its actually this very same complexity that makes us able to handle variations that we run into. Each link in a chain of dependent, interacting steps offers just enough wiggle-room that taken together, all the links actually can manage a large amount of variability.OK, ok, I know this is a bit abstract, so how about an example: imagine a human breathing at rest (maybe like you are, now, reading this newsletter!)......air gets pulled into lungs, where it is broken down in a split second so that oxygen can jump on the back of a little red blood cell and go for a quick run to somewhere in the body (through miles of circulatory plumbing) to deliver its oxygen cargo to a cell that needs it (muscle, skin, organ, etc). That oxygen then has to getintothe target cell (a complex process itself) before getting consumed as part of a set ofverycomplex cycles that use the oxygen, along with energy we get from food (carbs, fats, etc) to make the form of energy that our tissues can use to actually move (ATP).Now, dont worry, we wont be heading any further downthatbiochem rabbit-hole, but I wanted to run through it so you can get a feel for thehigh-wire balancing act that our bodies execute flawlessly with each and every breath.But it gets crazier. Lets say you were to stand up from rest, and start running down the street. All of a sudden, your body would be tasked with continuing to handle oxygenbut alsowould activate other (also complex) energy-providing systems to allow for this suddenvariation, and they would do it almost instantaneously.The only way that that huge change in demand (running vs resting) happens is if the job gets broken up into many, many smaller systems. That way, each system is only tasked with a small change within its own sphere of action. Together, these small changes make-up a flexible, resilient response to that new demand of running down the street.So when we want toimprove these systems--to fit ourselves more effectively to the whole realm of possible challenges we might face each day or week or year--one of the best things we can do is to simplycheck-inon the systems in question.Thats right: justusethem.In the example I walk thru above, that might look like spending some time really using your bodys aerobic (oxygen-using) pathway--like on a brisk walk--as well as its anaerobic pathways (eg when you start running fast).In the case of another complex system that we rely on each day--your system of joints and tissue--that check-in might look like a controlled circle through your largest, pain-free range of motion at each joint. This is quite literally a quick inventory of all the various positions that your body might move into, joint by joint. We call them Controlled Articular Rotations (CARs), and they are a powerful addition to any/everyones day (if youre curious,give em a shot!).By simplyusingthe range of motion you have, and doing so often, you are essentially accounting for thewiggle roomthat is your bodys way of dealing with whatever the world throws at you. Remember, its that wiggle room that makes the difference when it comes to handling an unpredictable variation--tripping off a curb, reaching under a table, carrying a heavy box--ornot. Trust me:you want to honor and maintain that wiggle room.No matter what body system youre looking to improve, the place to start is by simply engaging that system andusingyour capabilities.Youll be amazed at the miraculous human solutions youll find at work, hiding right under your noseGo find your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "It took more than a few years of being a personal trainer for me, Coach Will, to realize that the basics of human learning applied as much in the gym as they do in the classroom.But making this connection, and following through with what it implies, has both transformed my approach and vastly improved the outcomesandexperience of training for the people I work with.So while I do go into some depth here, Im hoping you come away with one main lesson:optimal learning not only helps you get better, faster, but also feels really, really good.First--the idea that learning should even be a part of an exercise experience is often somewhat new for the adults I work with. I draw this up to the fact that adults, in our society, are often not expected to be great learners; were supposed toalready have it figured out.This means that while many people start training with mebecausethey notice that there are gaps in their understanding--of themselves, their bodies, their health--that they want to fill in, they often dont grasp what that learning willfeellike. Really, what itmustfeel like, if we are going to actually believe the decades of research around how humans learn.Before we can even start any learning process we mustwantto learn. Im not talking about having a positive, engaged attitude (although that helps), but rather I mean having an intention, or agoal.Think back to when you learned to ride a bicycle, or learned to swim: youwantedto learn. Thats a critical component to any learning process, which is why we try to get to the bottom of each personswhyaround training on their first, initial call with us.From there, a key part of what optimal learningfeelslike is that it has feedbackbuiltright in.Here, I dont mean the feedback you get after the fact, that youd process with your think-y brain; I mean feedback that immediately impacts your experience, like when you start to lose balance on a bicycle. That loss of balance serves as an immediate feedback mechanism that allows you to immediately respond, correct, and with repetition, make automatic. That process, over and over,islearning in a nutshell.Without that feedback, we dont know when we are failing, and so we cant correct. In the game of learning, feedback is critical.Which is why unlocking these immediate feedback mechanisms is where we start with our training:are you, the mover, feeling all that the world (and your body) is offering as feedback?And since we learn from established anatomical science that much of what you feel when it comes to movement is coming through your joint capsules, we focus on making sure your capsules are working well and feeling good. Healthier capsules equals better feedback.But being engaged in activities that wewantto learn or improve at is not nearly as straight-forward as it might seem. After all, the feedback you feel from gravity while you ride a bike quickly becomes completely automatic, at which point learning to ride a bike is, well, not that interesting.At that point, when some learning hashappened, we need to keep engaging with tasks that are appropriately challenging if we are to keep learning and progressing.So that makesappropriate and sufficient challengethe third component of optimal learning. This is a moving target as we learn and improve, but it can be a critical missing component. Perhaps an activity is simply too easy, or becomes too easy as in the biking example above, at which point learning can stop.Just as often, an activity is just too hard or complex, and success is not even possible. In this case, the learning task either needs to be simplified or the learner has to increase their skills. The dialing-in of challenge, of figuring the right amount of challenge for a particular learner on a particular day, is an essential part of coaching/teaching well.The last component to optimal learning is to do so withattention and focus. While it might seem that if someone is motivated by a goal, theyre getting good instantaneous feedback, and theyre working at the right level of challenge forthem, learning should be a snap, that discounts the experience of the learner, which can doom the learning task.While learning, if we are focused on something unrelated to what were learning, we will not have the kind of brain bandwidth needed to synthesize a new experience with the feedback were getting simply because were distracted.This gets especially tricky for the over-thinkers among us (Dingdingding, thatd be me), as wethinkwere helping ourselves with our attentional focus while actually just getting in the way of receiving and responding to feedback.But theres another layer here, too...having attention/focus on what youre doing relies on the learnernotbeing distracted by life circumstances. If you, the learner, is stressed by work, family, or anything else, you simply will not be able to bring the focus to bear that contributes to optimal learning.And if coaches or teachers are ignorant of these circumstances, generally or specifically, they risk undermining the entire learning process, and, in the worst cases, blaming the learner for their difficulty. (This particular aspect is dense AF and deserves its own newsletter!)These four components that factor into optimal learning also define a physiological state you may have heard of:flow state, or more colloquially, being in the zone. Thats right...learning in an optimal wayisflow state, and flow stateisoptimal learning.Theres a lot to unpack here, but the part that makes me giddy is that if each of us can crack the code of how to learn optimally, we have the opportunity to hit two birds with one stone. We getbetterat whatever we want,andwe access one of the most powerful, positive ways of being a human that science has discovered.Of course, this also means that learning is the way that our brains feelbest.Its almost as if we are wired to learn. The hard part is removing any obstacles to that learning.So as you go forth, to care for yourself, enjoy yourself, and take in the world, I hope that keeping these four components in mind help you do so more effectively.Happy learning!

    "How We Help You Change": {
      "text": "My girlfriend always likes to joke about what a sucker I am.Specifically, how I always seem to get sucked into that last minute conversation about myjob(fitness) riiiiiiight as were about to leave a party.Oh yea, remember parties? Back when people got together in the same room, bare-faced and brazen?Le sigh...But shes right; I have a soft spot for that oonnnnne human who always seems to want to follow-up about what I do.Will, I had a question about what kind of training you offer?Its beenretired accountants, middle-aged cops, high school athletes and every stripe in between. And they all are curious about this thing that I do:help people move, better.Its a hard thing for me to describe quickly, at the tail-end of a party, but I try!I usually end up managing some kind of pile of jargon, gesturing and little details that relate it to what I perceive to betheirsitch.But Hannah and I realized something recently...weneedto be able to describe what we do, and we need to be able to say it off the cuff, to a slightly-buzzed, freshly met acquaintance, at a party (wheneverthathappens again).So here goes.We take the approach that having and enjoying a rich physical life comes down to three things:How well do you know your physical self?How well can you control physical self?What do youwantto do with your physical self?Our work is both to pose those questions, and arm you with the tools to really answer those questions, foryourself.We offer an online membership, that guides you through those first, awkward weeks of doing a few CARs each day (CARs are Controlled Articular Rotations,aka Joint-Butter , aka the way you \"wake up\" your proprioception and gain control of the full range of motion of your joints), and then on to those months of gradually realizing how muchmoreof the world there is to experience when your body isawakeandunencumbered.And because training is a journey, full of inner and outer obstacles, we offer on-going groupandprivate guidance about how to get stronger right whereyouneed it, in the time thatyouhave (no set-it-and-forget coaching with us).And as people get the hang of moving regularly in this thoughtful but intense way, an exciting thing starts to happen: all those physical challenges you've entertained (but backed away from) over the years start to sound a little lessscary, and little more...fun.Dancing in the kitchen sounds morefun, digging out the backyard sounds like morefun, even balancing on one foot while brushing your teeth sounds like morefun. Some of our clients even get reeeeaaalllll crazy and set agoal, like: Get my first pull-up or Backpack thru Yosemite.Except unlike other times when theyve set a goal, they are now engaging this challenge with a body that has beenlistened toandattended to. And their body has rewarded that care with a simple, yet powerful gift: itworks.Like how your car starts in the morning (most of the time ;), or your light switch turns on your lights, your body begins torespondwhen you call on it.And sure, it may occasionally rebel, and flip you the bird in the form of a cranky neck or a tweaked knee.But thats just a reminder to check back in with where you start with us:How well do you know your physical self?And, more importantly, what are you not aware of that means that your bodyhasto call out, in pain?So thats our process, in a nutshell. Much of this magic justcantbe described that well, until you have some felt experience with it. But our clients do a pretty good job ...\"WOW! I just took the first class you suggested and it is incredible! All the pain in my sitting bone is gone. I know its not gone for good, Ive got work to keep doing but I am feeling so grateful.\"\"We started at 6000 feet elevation, so I was huffing and puffing a bit, but by day two I could really feel how much stronger Ive become since I started these classes with you all. It felt powerful and helped me enjoy an activity that I already love, even more. Thank you both, for that! For reals.\"\"Initially, during Shelter-in-Place I was worried about training at home....At first I did the ZOOM workouts now and then out of a sense of guilt  I SHOULD work out. However, I noticed that I felt SO much better after a day at the computer when I did my session with The Fitness Alchemists. I felt lighter, stronger in my core and more in control of my movements.\"[Your classes] are truly wonderful, and Ive had some great breakthroughs recently with them, especially with some hip and shoulders bits.\"\"I just wanted to say thank you. From day one you both have been teaching my inner body how to take the shame out of disappointment. I think in the past I easily felt frustrated and even embarrassed over injuries and lack of skill. You have a way both in person and now over videos(magically) to help me move from this stuck feeling to getting excited and inspired where I am needing work. I feel so empowered and curious rather than helpless.Thank you for sharing your wealth of knowledge in such a kind, uplifting, and meaningful way.\"If working this way sounds interesting to you, wed love to get you started &lt;&lt;First Name>>. Hit reply, and say, OK, Im in and Ill get you all the info about how to get started.Or (for you go-getters, you curiosity-mavens, you people-who-would-grab-me-at-a-party-cuz-you-heard-Im-a-trainer)click HEREto book a call. We'd loveto show youwhat having jointsthat workreally feels like.Have a great weekend!Coach Will",

    "5 reasons to move TODAY": {
      "text": "I was interviewed recently by a chiropractor friend who was curious about how we go about sharing what we do--and why--with new or prospective clients. He is a client of ours, and really believes in it, but was having trouble formulating 'sound bites' that he could use to talk to his patients about our training.I realized that he was facing the very same challenge that we run into in trying to bridge the conceptual gap for our 'flock' (which is how we like to think of our clients...) between fitness/training that truly elevates their life experience, and the 'performative fitness' trends that most of us are used to finding when we go look for a fitness coach/trainer.It's such a dense, murky topic, and Hannah and I definitely approach it from multiple angles.The key is that everyone will come in the door with their own ideas about fitness based on their unique history, biases, beliefs, etc., and so their personalwhyis as individual as their finger print. That said, I identified 5 'reasons' that I often employ when engaging with prospective or new clients seem to resonate with folx from all backgroundsandrest on a solid scientific basis.Take a gander, and let me know which ones speak to you!Movement is how our bodies maintain themselvesThis is probably the single most important point, especially during shelter-in-place times. If people are stuck thinking of exercise as just for losing weight, or improving performance, this can be a good way to remind them that exercise and training are much more fundamental than any \"fitness-y\" goals. For people dealing with pain, the movements may need to be a little more specific, but we love engaging people in learning how to navigate these restrictions.When it comes to fitness, consistency is MUCH more important than intensitySo much fitness marketing is aimed at maximizing intensity (for a whole slew of competing reasons), but that often means: a.) exercise has a higher incidence of actually causing injury (rather than mitigating injury), b.) people stay away from exercise at all (\"If I can't do it intensely, I might as well NOT do it.\"). Instead, if consistency--actually building a movementpractice--can be the focus, people can better conceptualize moving more!Cells love to be loaded (AND it'sliterallyhow we can communicate to our tissues)This is for the more nerdy/analytical thinkers in the crowd, but can be a real \"aha!\" for people. Rather than framing training as merely about learning how to squat or do push-upsbetter, this point really helps folks connect with what's going on at the micro-level (ie in the cells). It also can be a way to describe the kind of training we do:\"TFA will help you actually communicate to your tissue, turning on the stuff that's 'asleep', and helping the over-active stuff learn how to relax.\"The key to a happy relationship with exercise is finding ways of moving that youenjoyMany, many people (in our experience) have beenburnedby their exercise/fitness experiences, thru injury, weird social interactions/expectations, or just plain burn-out. Letting them know that we are here to help them enjoy and live their livesbettercan be really reassuring when they're looking into getting started with training.Healthy, resilient joints are a *requirement* for any movement tasksSometimes, folks don't quite make the connection that any and all human movementhappensat their joints (I sure didn't have this realization before FRC!). So, if their joints are compromised in any way (by pain, limited range of motion, etc), their movement will be constrained. But that also means that if they canimprovethe function of their joints, ALL of their movement using that joint gets better.We always love talking with folx individually about if this kind of training might be a good fit, and how to get started. Seriously, just let us know and one of us willactuallyrespond (gasp!).Happy moving this weekend!Coach Will",

    "this relationship changed my life": {
      "text": "I dont think the Fitness Alchemists would exist today if I had never met Maureen Benson.{Coach Hannahhere, with a life-changing story to share!}Maureen was one of my first 1-1 clients when I moved to Oakland in 2014. We meet for a series of 5 sessions at the gym in my apartment building.At the time, I was offering a blend of Pilates and Strength Training, and we had good success getting her to feel better and stronger in her body, as well as getting her back into the swing of exercising regularly after a long period of not.Several months later,I wanted to start a small group that met regularly for Pilates. I didnt know how to make it happen, but I had a few 1-1 clients who had expressed interest. She was one of them.She had this way of asking me questions that would get me to gently call out my own fears around logistical roadblocks to the goal, and then see a myriad of solutions, just ripe for the picking.I started the Pilates group in a rent-by-the-hour conference room in my apartment building, and I tracked everyones visits and payments in a simple google spreadsheet.It was by no meansperfect  myself and the other class participants who showed up early would have to stack chairs and push the absurdly heavy round table as far into the corner as we could each week  but it worked.The women who came to my class every week were building on their knowledge, feeling better in their bodies, and getting stronger and more confident with the moves.They were sharing stories with me about how their bodies were feeling different during their daily lives. One woman felt less painful hip tightness during her work day, another felt less beat up after her weekly runs.The building changed its policy, and we suddenly lost our studio.I announced it in class, letting them know Id like to keep the group going, but I wasnt sure where we could meet. Id keep them posted, but next week might be our last class.Maureen sidled up to me as everyone was rolling up their mats, and moving chairs and tables back into position after class.Its just about to be summer we could meet outside on the grass down by the Jack London FerryAgain, something I never would have considered, but here was this confident woman, who wanted to keep learning from *me* so much that she was willing to help me trouble shoot where to hold class.I couldnt ignore it.Her steadfast faith in me ignited my courage to try things that made me slightly uncomfortable.We kept that class going for 2 years, finally hosting it in my living room once Forrest and I moved into our current house.By that point, I was working full time for a small boutique bootcamp-type gym in Jack London.I was getting clear that it wasnt the right place for me, but I didnt know what I really wanted to do. I was convinced that starting my own fitness business was a terrible idea  that all studio owners were overworked, had no time for themselves, and barely made ends meet even if the studio or gym were successful because the margins were so narrow in the fitness industry.I was also still thinking of my life in terms of day job and real work/art at that time.Not all of you know this about me, but I did theatre very seriously from age 12-30. I really only stopped when I moved to Oakland in 2014.Training had been the thing I stumbled upon that paid me the best hourly rate, and gave me the most free time to do my art.And yet, in 2016, I was coaching 35 hours a week at this gym, whos values for relating to the body didnt 100% align with mine.At the end of a 7 coaching shift, I did NOT have any energy left to do my real work.I wanted more time to do MY stuff.But I was convinced that working for myself would be a step in the opposite direction, and would eat up ALL of my time.In some ways, I wasnt wrong.But what I didnt account for  couldnt imagine, even  was that working for myself would allow me the permission to weave my true selfintomy work.Im pretty sure thats all art is anyway. Making something, for the collective, that is of and from your own creative self.Maureens gentle persistence and curious questions nudged me past the structures of assumptionthat were standing in my way.The story of Will and I beginning The Fitness Alchemists, over a series of exquisite cappuccinos at Modern Coffee in Downtown Oakland, is a longer one for another day. But it has its roots in this story.I am so grateful to Maureen for seeing in me what I couldnt yet see in myself.My work today,The Fitness Alchemists, is aligned with my values, calls on my creativity, expands my sense of myself and the world.And best of all, it feels sustainable. Im not some strung-out-on-stress gym owner who can never take a break to nap, or meditate, or even do my own workout. In fact, Will and I have 10 minute naps BUILT IN to our daily schedule.Because of the Pandemic, we have had to adapt in a major way over the past 6 months, switching from a full schedule of in-person classes to an online coaching model. At first this forced change was devastating. I didnt think I had the bandwith to reinvent our entire business.The day after Shelter in Place was officially announced here in Alameda country, who reaches out? Maureen Benson.Her email was like a breath of fresh air and a hydrating sip of possibility:Hi Hannah and Will,I'm so inspired by how hard you're working (and showing up) to be powerfully responsive to the community needs in this critical time.I really, really appreciate you!I also wanted to follow up and share thatafterdeepprayerandcontemplation(and budgeting), in April (or whenever you open again) I'd like to do the unlimited Kinstretch with personalized programming.Looking forward to regular training, as I'm real clear we all do so much better in community and I just love how ya'll are building such a great space and methodology.Then shelter in place dragged on but lo and behold on April 2, she texts meHi sweets! Just bumping up that Id love to officially start and send you some of my money so that we can get going on whatever virtual partnership this new reality will allow us to have! Sending you all my love and appreciation!Once again, she had faith in my work in its infancay, way before I could feel proud about our online offerings.Today, one year after opening our studio in Oakland, 6 months after having to close abruptly due to Covid, I am so proud of the way we are helping people.And the hidden gem is, we get to help people all over the country, because that is the beauty of an online membership that isn't tied to a class schedule.The power of someone believing in you before you can quite believe in yourself is REAL. If you could use that kind of support with your movement practice, please reach out.I would love to pay this forward.We are on-boarding folx who want to start anonline membership with us in October THISweek (10/5-10/9) and we have 3 spots left.If you feel like one of them might be yours,let's talk.In gratitude,HannahP.S. Maureen puts out a great podcast called Eyes on Whiteness which we highly recommend if youre interested in a resource for understanding the ways white supremacy and patriarchy show up in our culture, regardless of intent.",

      "text": "Hey there,Well here we are, in the fall of 2020, and what a time it is.Considering the ridiculous obstacles were all facing, I think its important to take a moment to send some appreciation to the body that has gotten each of us to this point.Go ahead, give that body a pat on the back. Hell, give it a hug. You deserve the shit out of it.Ahhh, thats better. Its so easy to lose sight of the work that each of our bodies do, behind the scenes, each and every day. But all it takes to unwind that uneven relationship is to spend a little love, and check in with your body like you would with a close friend.The way that this can shift our attitude (and therefore our approach to training) is part of why I love talking with new folx about their fitness journey and goals.Especially as a personal trainer, a title that comes indelibly stamped with that gym-rat stereotype, it can come as a surprise when I begin our conversation with curiosity about how theyre currently taking care of their body.Not how they are crushing it, or pushing it, but how they are honoring the relation they have to their physical body.The reality is that each of us do some amount of care for our bodies, every day. We all sleep and eat. We all feel the pull to reach for a delicious stretch in the morning, and many, many of us recognize the boost we can get from a short walk around our neighborhood.As simple as those pieces seem, they often make up the extent of the ways that we interact with our bodies and its needs.But the fitness questions really start to come up when folx start considering how to move beyond a base-level of body relations. How can they cajole their body to change in a specific way? And, critically, how can they do it without hurting themselves?This exact topic came up in a call last week with a new client.She mentioned that she hated gyms and gym-culture, and had decided in her early thirties that she did not need to fuck with gyms ever again. Despite my background, I found her directness refreshing, hilarious, and legitimate; mainstream fitness culture has hurt a lot of people, inside and out.But she was still interested in shoring up some areas of her body that regularly cried out in fear and pain, especially whenever she tried to move more in the ways that she loves. Several courses of physical therapy had allayed the acute pain in her ankle and neck, but left the underlying insecurity about if she could actually trust those joints.She then called out how the ways that she saw to work on her body and (potentially) clear up those issues seemed like a big jump. Rather than building her inner sense of security and safety, most fitness options she had tried and researched just plain didnt respect the inner boundaries (what and what didnt feel ok to her physical body) that she had cultivated over years as a yoga teacher.And then she said the thing that connected her with soooo many other clients that weve worked with: There just seems to be this gap between what healthcare can do for me, and what I want my body to do.There surely is a gap between pain mitigation (the work of health care) and realizing our physical dreams, and bridging that gap is our work at the Fitness Alchemists.Whether we are helping build awareness of the gap (between what you can and cannot do safely, right now) or working on steadily spanning the gap (with progressive strength training), our goal is that people find a way back to trusting their physical bodies.Body-trust quickly clears the path for body-confidence, which is the stuff that rich, physical lives are made of.If this gap is something youve grappled with, Id love to hear about it. And if youre curious how we might go about bridging that gap for you, book a call with me...Id love to chat. ;)Go be a hero,Coach Will",

      "text": "Probably the BIGGEST reason someone hires me is related to motivation.I know I should workout, but I really struggle with motivationOr motivations pro dom: accountabilityAs in, \"I just know I need some accountability or it won't happen.\"Id like to posit that motivation has its roots in the relationship you have with your body.If you are struggling to motivate to move, the most valuable thing you can do is to curiously investigate this question:What is my relationship with my body?A metaphor is helpful here.What makes a healthy relationship between two people?(e.g. a marriage, a partnership, a friendship, a parent-child relationship, etc)Good communicationTrustLoveAnything else? Thats really it. Everything else I can think of roots back to those three.Now lets get back to you + your bodyDo you communicate well with your body?Do you trust your body?Do you love your body?We can break each of these big questions into smaller questions:CommunicationDo I listen to my body, and understand what its asking for?Do I know how to communicate what I want from my body to my body in a way that creates a specific change?TrustDo I trust that my body is strong enough to withstand the demands of the activities that I love/that are important to me?Do I trust that my body can heal when it gets hurt?LoveDo I treasure my body?Do I believe my body to be worthy no matter what it does, looks like, or doesnt do or doesnt look like?If you found this helpful, and youd like a coach to help you with THIS kind of work, lets talk.This shit is my JAM.In devotion to our resilience,Hannah",

    "Kitchen Alchemy: Thai-Inspired Chicken Soup to Boost Immunity": {
      "text": "         That cold that has been going around finally caught up with me. Sunday night I felt the oh-so-familiar scratchiness in my throat, and I know it had come for me. I took Sunday night to be super lazy and watch all the netflix, but on Monday I decided to take action, and I cobbled together this version of the classic remedy for the common cold: Chicken Soup.First a side note: I am OBSESSED with Thai coconut chicken soup, or Tom Kha Gai. So far I have yet to find a restaurant in Oakland that has an awesome one on their menu. If you know of a spot with stellar soup, hit me up in the comments!! Please. Seriously. DO IT NOW.Ok, but since I haven't found one, I've been working on making my own. This version is the best I've come out with so far, so I will share it will you, gorgeous humans.Thai-Inspired Chicken SoupINGREDIENTS2 quarts Unsalted Chicken broth (Imake my ownfor extra nutritional value--it's super easy! but you can also use store bought if you are in a pinch)1 rotisserie chicken2 thumbs worth of fresh ginger (or more to taste)3 stalks lemongrass1 can coconut cream or 2 cans coconut milk (NOT lite)1-3 tspThai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (depending on how much spice/flavor you prefer)1 bell pepper1lb mushrooms (I used white button mushrooms, but any kind will do)1-2 bunches of kale or any dark leafy green4-5 Carrots2 tsp Sea Salt (or Fish Sauce) + more to taste2 limes4-5 stalks of cilantro PREPSlice ginger root (thickness should be 1/4 inch or less--you want to expose lots of surface area so the broth will infuse. Don't bother peeling it)Remove any dried outer layers of lemongrass, then chop it into 1.5 inch piecesDIRECTIONSPour your broth into a large soup pot, add 1 tsp salt, and bring broth to a boil (you want the salt to dissolve). TASTE YOUR BROTH. If it tastes amazing already, you have added enough salt. It it tastes like something is missing but you don't know what, add another half teaspoon of salt and return to boiling. Taste again. Rinse repeat until that broth tastes crazy good.Dont skip this step  this is the KEY to satisfying soup, and will be very unique to the individual. #GoldilocksMomementTurn the heat down to med/low to achieve a lovely simmer, and dump in ginger and lemongrass. Let that ish simmer for AT LEAST 20 mins. The longer you simmer, the deeper the flavor, but we all gotta eat, and a weeknight is a weeknight, so...Use the 20min simmer to prep your other veggies:De-stem and chop or tear kale into bite-size piecesthinly slice carrots ( a mandolin works well here, I used my Cuisinart with the mandolin blade)Remove the seeds, then quarter and thinly slice bell pepperThinly slice mushroomsremove chicken from bones, set aside. Strain the ginger and lemongrass out of the broth (a slotted spoon works well here)Add curry paste and stir to combine/dissolveAdd your most dense veggies first (kale & Carrots) and simmer for 5-7 minutes. Taste a carrot--if it is no longer crunchy, you're good,Add mushrooms and bell peppers, simmer for another 5 minutes.Add coconut milk or creamAdd chicken and simmer 5 mins to warmTop with Cilantro and a lime wedge for extra fancinessSlurp it out of big bowls and feel better almost immediately!          Why do I call this Immunity Soup?Great question. The ingredients are specifically chosen for their nutrient density, and immunity-boosting properties.Red Bell peppers & carrots are a rich source of Vitamin CMushrooms are anti-inflammatory and boost immune response (read thefull report on PubMed)Kale is incredibly nutrient-dense, as well as having\"high antioxidant activity\"Chicken bone broth is a rich source of collagen, which your body breaks down into amino acids (The building blocks of all life) and uses to repair anything that needs it. It is also hydrating, and can help replenish electrolytes. For an unbiased and thorough investigation,check out this article from NPR.Fresh ginger has been shown to helpfight respiratory infections, lower overall inflammation, reduce muscle soreness, andimproves your digestion. #Winning",

    "I almost missed out on the love of my life": {
      "text": "I met Forrest when I was a tender lil 20 yr old studying Acting at Boston University. Weve been together now for 15 years and counting, and I can say with deep clarity, he is the love of my life. I mean, look at us!          This is us cleaned up nice for a friends wedding in October 2019.     But back when we met, I wasnt immediately attracted to him.   He didnt register on my radar as a hot guy which is ABSURD to me now, because I look at pictures like that oneand go O MY GODDESS this man is SO HANDSOME it HURTS my EYES.I was caught up in a couplewebs of delusion about BODIES in those days that are just now starting to come clear to me.I think its important to talk about this publicly because I almost missed out on this epic love of my life because I was so wrapped up in thisbullshit.Bullshit web #1:Women must be smaller than the men they date.You know, in all the Disney movies from the 80s how the Prince's hand SWALLOWS the princess' hand whole? That.Bullshit Web #2:Body Size Hierarchyaka some bodies are better than others. In this case, smaller/thinner bodies are \"better\"and bigger or \"plus-sized\" bodies are \"bad.\"Back to me and Forrest.We were part of the same friend group, so we ended up hanging out weekly. I really liked talking to him  he was and is dazzlingly intelligent, deeply philosophical, bitingly funny, and listens with great care.We even had a little bit of flirty chemistry working.Im a sucker for wordplay -- #ShakespeareNerd -- and he was a wizard at it.But I was like, nah. Not that one.Then my roommatestarted feeding me this story that I should date Forrest because he thought I was sooooo hotTurns out this was a lie, I asked him about this nonsense and he said hedidthink I was attractive, but he hadnt said anything about it to her. smh.But because I was wrapped up in the web of #BodyHierarchy I was convinced that I wasnt very attractive, and therefore could only choose from men who found ME attractive.In other words I didnt even ask myself who I desired or found attractive, because I just assumed I wouldnt have a chance with them.But my roommate's nudges made me look at him differently.I leaned into the flirty banter. I started making subtle physical contact.Then one night, after more than a few drinks, at one of those casual college parties, we found ourselves in the kitchenin front of a refrigerator that was covered in a confetti of magnet poetry.Remember magnet poetry? Yeah, that.We tumbled drunkenly in to a game not unlike Exquisite Corpse:I wrote one line...He wrote the next...We traded back and forth, the excitement building, until I found the words:Kiss me and a ?...I felt electrified as I paced them under our column of collaborative prose....Giddy as I moved my body back away from the fridge to reveal to him what I had written.He looked at me with this loin-melting face, and said oh, girlAnd then scooped me into his arms and kissed me like it was the rom com of my dreams.There were like 8 other people sitting around the kitchen table playing poker, but I didnt give a flying fuck.I dont really remember what happened next, but we ended up going back to his apartment, fooling around, and then falling asleep in his *twin* bed.It stands to reason that I would not have slept very well in a tiny-assunfamiliarbed. I mean, he is 61 and Im 58 so the body geometry alone should have meant poor sleep.But I woke up feeling like Id had the best night of sleep of mywhole actual LIFE.Turns out, he felt the same way.What?!?This was the first (of several) nudges from the universe that this man was MY man.The partner I had never dreamed I might have.The deep love who saw ALL of me and was excited to adventure by my side.Again, I was 20. So I wasnotready for this jelly.And I was caught up in that other webWomen must be smaller than men.I remember saying to one of my girl friends, I really like him but I dont knowww. Like, his arms are smaller than MINE as though that was an obvious dealbreaker.I just couldnt conceive of physical attraction outside of the Disney prince + princess proportions I had grown up with.This brings up another aspect of the #BodyHieracrchyDelusion that I was wrapped up in:I realized just recently that I have always considered myself to be plus sized.(And until I was 30, I just assumed thatbeing plus sized was a bad thing -- I know better now.)In reality, I never was.My body has fluctuated a bit during my life, but at my largest I was a size 10/12.In other words, Ive always been able to shop at normal stores, I have not been forced to search the internet for clothing that will accommodate my body.(For further reading on this, I highly recommendthis articleby@yrfatfriend)When I met Forrest, I was a relatively lean size 8.And yet, I wasconvincedthat I needed a man who could dwarf me so that I woulda) look feminine enough next to him, andb) so that he could be attracted to me and I could be attracted to him.I ALMOST didnt pursue a connection that my body was BEGGING me to explore, because my brain was being a steeped-in-diet-culture asshole.Yall.It is SO important that we start dismantling these harmful ideas about bodies.We must get off the #BodyHieracrchy ladder. It is harmful, limiting, and causes us to miss out on the good in life.Not only that, but folks in trulyplus-sizedbodies are sufferig from these webs of delusion.They are receiving violence online & IRL, being denied proper medical care, and are excluded from basic shit like being comfortable in a chair (because most chairs are made for thin people as though thinis \"the norm.\")I want to invite us to comb through our history, and identify the webs ofdelusions we may have been wrapped up in that limited our own lives.It can be a painful process, but it is the surest way to build empathy for others, and become better allies.#MyBodyIsMyAllyTo our collective resilience,HannahP.S. for more on the concept of the Body Hierarchy Ladder, listen tothis BRILlIANT episodefeaturing Sonya Renee Taylor on Brene Browns Unlocking Us Podcast. You wont regret it, and it might just change your life.",

    "The #1 mistake you might be making in your workouts": {
      "text": "Hey,This mistake is SO OBVIOUS (now that I see it clearly) but is literally the most common thing that everyone overlooks.It's one of those small changesthat has an outsized positive impact on your body, and therefore, your LIFE.Most people, and even mosttrainers, dont invest enough time & energy in getting a clear sense  a felt sense oftheir unique starting point.It takes a regular practice, I would argue a daily practice, dedicated to simply understanding where one is in the present moment, in order to truly have the information needed about where we are beginning.Clearly knowingwhere we are starting fromallows us totake the needed first step in the direction that we wish to go.Ive watched so many clients and loved ones misunderstand where they are starting from, and take the step thatseems likethe first step, only to get feedback from their bodies thatit was actually the 10th step. Oops.This generally knocks them back to square 1, or even square -2,which emotionally feels likesquare -15.So my question to you today is:How much of your dedicated movement practice time during the week are you devoting to asking your body these questions:where am I?what is available in this present moment?I'd love to hear your answer.Before I sign off, I'll shareone more helpful thing:This videois 16mins long, and walks you throughthe exact set of movements we teach our clients to use for daily self-assessment + awareness building.Its free on our YouTube channel.Give it a try.If you have questions about any of the moves, I'd love to talk you through it.Reply here, and I'll get back toyou in a couple of days.To taking the actual 1st step,HannahPSSo...the holidays are here!And that usually means more than usual family/social time and hectic schedules anda drop off of our personal movement practice.Who knows what this will be like during covid...But just in case, we are running a challenge during the2nd half of December to support our members in maintaining their commitment of doing at least 10mins of movement practice every day.Im thinking we could open it up to the general public, without too much hassle on our end.Would you be game for something like that?Lemme know if youd like to do that with us and Ill make sure we invite you when registration opens up.",

    "What We Won't Sell You": {
      "text": "Theres always a temptation, when you run a small fitness business, to turn physical activity into a commodity.To see human bodies as the mere backdrop for a pre-packaged, generic Workout of the Day.To see each new person as a sale first, and a miraculous human-animal (with infinite consciousness) second.Coach Will here, and I know this tendency well ... because I used to think of fitness--and clients--this way, too.But (if its not already obvious) my thinking has changed drastically on this point.I came to realize thatBusiness tends to favor products that are not diverse, opting instead for things that offer lots of consistency and repeatability and leave little room for variation. This approach is much easier to optimize for efficiency, and offers a much bigger reward when you scale up. Examples of this abound but a few that come to mind are... Starbucks coffee (they slightly burn all of it to ensure consistent taste), McDonalds potatoes for french-fries (theyre bred to be one shape so theyre easier to cut up), and 50-min group workouts (that fit neatly into an hour and allow for maximum face time for a trainer/coach, no matter what the client needs).Humans tend to thrive when they are becoming themselves, and not trying to fit into some generic or low-key coercive mold. On this path toward self-becoming (rather than conforming), diversity and variability are a strength that offers flexible solutions to obstacles.So while I naturally want this here Alchemical business to succeed, I also know that denying the human aspects of fitness (intrinsic variation) in favor of the more business-minded aspects (intrinsic consistency) would rob us of the magic that makes this work so meaningful.Which brings me to the point of this here email (finally ): why we, The Fitness Alchemists, dont offer gift cards. (mostly*)As in--we dont offer folx the ability to buy sessions or packages for someone else.When I share this with people, they always give me that puppy-question face          What? You dont want my money? I wanna buy some of your awesome training for a dear loved one!Welp...no we dont. For one reason:Because weve discovered that (over many years, and many gift cards sold) one of the most critical moments for our members is when they decide to spend their coin on our training.In a weird way, weve realized that the wallet-out moment represents a line, a threshold, that represents them giving consent to be coached.Without that consent, nothing will really work to help that person get where they want to go with our coaching...not the perfect program of exercises, or the most motivational messaging, or even that weird, bullying-style of coaching (which is another no-no for us).Consent--in this context, and alllllll the others--is just that important.And just like were not interested in selling a product that fits better in a business model, but fits worse on the real humans we work with, were not interested in taking money without that consent.So what can you do if you really want to get a friend or loved one some Fitness Alchemy for the holidays?You can tell them about usTell them how we are re-imagining what fitness looks and feels like.Tell them that were tossing out the shitty and destructive social norms around bodies, and inviting individual felt experience instead.Tell them how were straight slaying at Instagram (you follow us over there, right?), posting free stuff on YouTube and hell--tell em to get on our newsletter list!And let them decide to start training with us when theyre ready.This has been one hell of a year, but we're really excited about what's coming down the pike for 2021, and we're so stoked that you are here for that adventure.Have a great weekend!- Coach Will*we DO encourage family/friends of clients to buy our training on behalf of clients, cause in that case the client has already consented to coaching.",

      "text": "Heyyyy there...Coach Will here, cuz I just had to share a thought with you that has been, well, super impactful for me recently, in multiple realms. 'K here it is...\"You can't find what you're not willing to look for.\"- Sonya Renee TaylorThat's it! So short, so simple...so true.If anything, during this age when it feels like everyone is sharing allllllll the content, wisdom seems to pop out of the noise even more clearly.Which is exactly how this quote feels each and every time I hear Sonya mention it (via her Instagram videos, various podcasts, or in her writing): wise.It feels that way because it so clearly captures the not-so-comfortable sensation--as a White American cis-man--of realizing my own privilege within our heavily hierarchical society.I can viscerally sense the ways in which, deep down, I may not *want* to accept the lived reality of so many of my fellow humans--daily doses of racism, sexism, gender-ism, able-ism, size-ism and xenophobia--because of what it says about me (and people who look like me).How it uncovers what I don't WANT to see about myself.And that realization is only a macro-version of a dynamic that permeates our lives....The micro-version shows up in all the ways I have ignored nagging aches and pains in my body, or dismissed negatively charged interactions with the people I love, or, or...And just as I am thankful for the gradual expansion in my understanding around the oppressive structures that under-gird our society (from the likes of Sonya, and many others), I am also deeply, if begrudgingly, grateful for other instances of painful realization:realizing that my right hip wasn't going to just stop hurting on its ownrealizing that my business--the Fitness Alchemists--wasn't going to become what I envisioned without getting clear on *exactly* why I do itrealizing that being honest is not the same as being niceSound familiar?What Sonya is pointing at is a phenomenon that has been studied and discussed since (at least) the '60s: Cognitive Dissonance.And all that research has shown that it a.) EXISTS, and b.) is almost impossible to notice in action, from the first-person perspective; it is a truly SUBconscious reflex that our mind engages when we're faced with identity-threatening information.So the next time you have a chance for some Deep Thinking, when you're feeling safe and grounded, I encourage you to give some time to this question...What am I resistant to, or unwilling, to look at in my life? And why?Hope you're navigating the season ok--it's tough out there!To your resilience,Coach Will",

    "Ever wanna just give up on movement?": {
      "text": "Hey,I wanted to share a quick story about one of our newer members.She came to us with chronic pain, and a history of trying to get into a workout routine but being sidelined by familiarpain (or new injury) at every. single. attempt.She really wanted to get stronger, be more active, and just feel good in her body but she had been burned so many times that she was beginning to doubt if that would be possible.We agreed to give it a try. Thats all signing up to work together as coach and clientreally is:Consent to give it a go.During her first two months, she started feeling less pain in her usual spots.She feltwas encouraged and motivated by the way we invited her to adjust the classes to meet her body where it is, rather than requiring that she rise to a certain level, regardless of how she was feeling.Then last week we checked in and she was feeling pretty demoralized because her pain was back.We hoped on a coaching call, and talked through what she had been doing in her exercise program to see if there were any subtle shifts we could make to help her feel better.We found a few, and she found a renewed thread of hope to carry on.After the call, I wrote her this message:Im having another insight about your current experience of pain.I dont feel that I have this totally well organized, but Im gonna go for it anyway because its whats coming through.When we have dealt with pain for a long time  particularly a pain that has attempted to interfere with us living our lives, one strategy that we adopt to survive and continue living is to disconnect from and effectively ignore the pain.This is totally natural, and makes complete logical sense. So lets just normalize that experience.When we decide to re-engage with our bodies with the aim of increasing our presence and embodiment, all of the pain that we shoved to the side may demand to be felt and truly witnessed.As this pain surfaces in a newly-embarked upon movement + embodiment journey, this can feel like a step backwards if we are looking at pain/no pain as a binary progress indicator.I would invite you to see this increased awareness of your present state, pain included, as a step forward in your healing journey.As a necessary step forward in connecting with yourself.We can only move what we canfeel.HannahIf you are struggling with pain, or anything that makes you feel like you might want to just give up on movement all together, I see you.That feeling is super real.And, if there is a sliver of your being that still wants to move, but doesnt know how to carry onward in the overwhelm, I can help.We just opened up enrollment for our 4 week online program,Getting Unstuck. We start on Monday Jan. 11, 2021.Check it out, and if you have any questions about the program or its rightness for you at this moment in your journey, lets talk.To our resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "What if this was the year when you finally got into allyship with your body?What if this was the year when loving your body or loving how you feel stopped being empty platitudes and started to click? When pain stopped being an adversary and started being a valued advisor?What if this year you had some of those moments you remember having as a kid, and you hear about from other people, when the physical sensation of moving your arms and legs made you down-right giddy?...like riding full-blast downhill on a bike?...or turning a corner on a trail to behold the most incredible view?...or, after finishing something that really tested your body, lapping up the wave of relief and joy that follows?I, Will Belew, am convinced that within each of us there is a treasure trove of sensations--pleasurable, painful, insightful, novel and familiar--that already include allll the answers we need to navigate toward this kind of relationship with our body.Finding those sensations isnt too hard, even if they are obscured behind snap-judgements we have about ourselves (like: no pain no gain! So this workout must not be doing anything  this is poppycock).At the same time, if were talking about pain, there are some sensations that are almost impossible to ignore.Either way, positive or negative, seeking out the information our body has to offer is something that can happen right now, just by settling your focus on what you feel.We just gotta do it (and want to do it ).That doing it part, especially as weeks roll into months, years, and decades--thats the real sticky spot. Hanging in there with those sensations--good or bad--and valuing them enough to let them shape your actions.... now thats tough.Its tough for a whole litany of reasons, like the fact that us humans love to find the *fastest* way to a goal (and miss important scraps of info along the way), or that weve practiced the habit of dismissing our own sensations, over and over, in favor of what our culture tells us to think and feel.Whatever the block or blocks might be, the pie-in-the-sky transformations we dream about will run into rough patches, and well get stuck. So, after years and years of coaching people before, during and after resolution season, I see now that what we need, much more than any single spurt of motivation or magic bullet, is an approach that will help us work through those blocks by:Arming us with tools to find and understand the vast sensory information from our bodiesProviding support and structure for us externally, like scaffolding, until we have sufficiently established that stability internally (and even then, external structure can be a huge leg-up)Not just offering us someone elses approach to try on, but is actually self-guided, self-directed, and able to shift with us as life happens (cuz, ya know, life happens)And we all need these things.Whether your goal is to feel confident getting up off the floor or winning a gold-medal, your efforts will always be dictated by one thing: the relationship you have with your body.Heres to finding your gold, this January and beyond,Coach Will",

      "text": "The birds are chirping here in Oakland, CA and it is a mercifully warm day. I wish I could bottle up some of this sweet sunshine and beam it to you through this screen.Instead, Ill share a little snippet of coaching that happened in our membership app recently, that Ill bet you might be able to relate to.This client was having a tough time doing their weekly movement invitations from us, and on top of that, was being really hard on themselves for missing the mark.We had a quick call, and I suggested that we down-shift the assignment from DOING the exercises, to at least checking in and sharing with us through the apphow they were feelingabout doing the exercises each day.Heres what they wrote back:Client:Well, I think its true that reflecting is probably the most important part andthenthe actual exercises. My initial instinct is to give up because Im failing. But I guess really, I have plenty of opportunities to keep trying?Coach Hannah:Yes, manymanyopportunities.I just wanna lift up what you just said: reflecting is the most important partThis is so true.Being able to notice your thoughts, experiences, impulses, stories  all the things that come up in relation to your body and movement  is really important.This is the scaffolding that is essential, if the goal is to build a movement practice that is based in self-honoring rather than external accountability.Thanks for checking in! Might we agree to count a daily check in as a success, and doing any movement as a BONUS? How does that feel?Client:That works for me. Checking in is clearly important, and I can already see one similar situation I could probably apply this approach to in my life.In case you are having similar feelings of failure for not meeting atargetyouve set for yourself,Im offering a gentle reminder to get curious, and allow yourself to notice what resistance comes up for you.Its so easy to ignore those stuck moments, or try to fast-forward through them to get to the part of the movie where we already are who we long to be.I know that feeling so well!Those sludgy moments where we ARENT DOING THE THING are rich, fertile soil.Theres lots to discover there about who we are, who we arent, and how we can tend to ourselves in the ways that will truly nourish us.On we merrily stumble,Hannah",

    "What Bird Beaks Have to Do With Working Out": {
      "text": "Hey, its Coach Will checking in on you as we enter[scary voice] February.I have a quick story for you I just learned about, and it might just shift how you see training your bodyId love to hear what you think:In 1973, a couple British scientists (who happened to be married) landed on Daphne Major, one of the small volcanic islands that make up the Galapagos Archipelago.Peter and Rosemary Grant were there to camp out and take on-going measurements of the finches that call Daphne Major home, as part of larger research questions about natural selection.The island offered some special advantages--isolation, mostly--which also made the work a true labor of commitment, even for just that first 6 month stint.I say just because they kept--keep--coming back for 40+ years.40 years of measuring birds.From the sounds of it though, these two couldnt be happier about their situation, perhaps because those measurements have provided some of the most important evidence of how evolution actually works, in real-time.Ok, so pausing the low-key biology class for a sec somehow, these two were able to stay focused on a long-term question, day in and day out, for 4 decades.In a very tangible way, their deep curiosity was sufficient to guide and energize their way, to give them the drive to fill thousands of water-proof notebooks with precise measurements of population size, feeding habits, bodies, and beaks.There are so many parallels to fitness and training that I kept yelping while reading about them**, much to my girlfriends annoyance Like, how the Grants literally did not know what they would discover, even while they knew theyd have to be there for at least a decade to get even a scrap of insight. They were satisfied with merely asking big, interesting questions.What if we embarked on the project of training our bodies with even a fraction of this perspective? What if instead of goals we were powered by questions?Or, how intimately the Grants came to know the finch populations. In addition to creating powerful statistical models that helped them see how the populations were changing over time (ie big picture info), Peter apparently could identify every individual bird by site most seasons (600 - 1000+ individuals ...thats some serious detail).What would knowing ourselves (with that type of high and low-level) clarity mean for our relationship with our bodies? What kind of body wisdom would we find intuitively, by feel, with no need for outside experts?Now Im not proposing that we all go out and buy those hyper-accurate calipers and start measuring our beaks (). No, were lucky to have a tool thats much better-suited to knowing ourselves, physically: CARs (aka Controlled Articular Rotations).Complete with a nerdy-sounding name, these movements offer a way of scientifically researching ourselves, and the results can be profound, especially if we stick with it for a few weeks, months, or <gasp> decades.The thing is, CARs give us that intimate detail and that big-picture view of how things change. They help us answer the important questions.And as a bonus, a full body set (about 10mins) makes just about the best daily physical routine we can think of.So good in fact that we made a follow-along video that you can watch (for free) on YouTube, because we think theyre just that important/cool. (Theres a bunch more free-free on our channel right now, too!)Heres to finding your gold (even in February ),Coach WillPS: If you check out the CARs routine, like it, and want more of this kind of thing, hit that Subscribe button...it helps us know that this is a useful channel for our peeps (aka you)!** I read about the Grants and all the ways that their findings have impacted our view of the world in Justin Wieners excellent book, called The Beak of the Finch  BIG recommend if you like dense (but highly readable) non-fiction ",

    "An Antidote to Perfectionism": {
      "text": "I started calling myself a #RecoveringPerfectionist as a joke.Which is what I do when things are intense  lighten the mood with a witty turn of phrase that makes everyone around me feel more comfortable.{Coach Hannah, here, in case you hadn't already guessed!}But as Ive lived with it, this name, it has become clear to me that perfectionism is incredibly addictive and debilitating, much like any other form of addiction.It can hijack us.Even when weve had a long stretch without any major relapses.I realized I was doing myself a disservice by imagining that I would kick this habit for good.I realized that it would be kinder and more supportive to create a toolkit for how to bring myself back home when this shit kicks up (which it inevitably will.)Play has been magical for me.When that perfectionist mindset is running the show, we can get caught up in the am I doing this right? What if I do it wrong? Best not to do anything at all trap.Play lifts the latch.When we frame a movement as a gamewith clear parameters but no one right answerand invite ourselves to simply play the game  we free ourselves up to MOVE.Playis defined as engaging in activity for enjoyment and recreation rather than a serious or practical purpose.\"Take a moment.Think backto the last time you \"exercised\" or \"worked out\"  did it have any of the qualities of play?I want to take this definition of play a bit further, and share one I first heard in a talk by BrenBrown, from theepic research on play by Stuart Brown.  (They arent related, btw, just same last name.)According to his research, play can be many things, but it always has threekey characteristics:Play is purposelessPlay is all-consuming (you lose track of time, and are fully in the present moment)Play is funI don't know about y'all, but even just writing this, Iam realizing that I need more of that in my life.Especially now, in pandemic times.Play can be that vacation from the hard realities that we face that re-fills our cup so we can keep going.So here's my invitation to you:If you'd like more play in your life, take some time to journal your answers to these questions:Is there a way that you feel perfectionism keeping you still?What might playful movement look/feel like for you?If youd like, share them with me, and then lets create a game together to get you moving.xx,Coach Hannah",

    "The 2 Keys to \u2018Sticking With It\u2019": {
      "text": "I dont know whats going on, really.\" She sounded down.\"The last few weeks I havent been doing anything physical, really, other than walking the dogs.\"<sigh>\"I guess Im just wondering if you have any  ideas.We were 5 minutes into her monthly coaching call, and she had just talked me through how her workout routine was off'. She was trying her best to not to feel guilty about it, but she still did.The last few months have been tough for C; like pretty much all of us she had cycled through some weeks of dedicated daily movement (good weeks, in her assessment), while also hitting stretches--like this one--of just not.Well, sort of .Sparkling like a glimpse of gold amidst the dirt was that passing comment she had tossed in at the end, nonchalant: ...other than walking the dogs.For whatever reason, her daily dog walk didnt qualify in her mind as a workout.So I asked some questions.It turned out her daily walk was a bit more potent than she had estimatedEvery day, she would walk around her neighborhood for 20 or 30 minutes, doing her best to tire out her 1-year-old pup.And as a working mom, it also offered a rare moment away from all the competing demands she faced every waking hour.She went on, describing her walks with the dog: It just feels so good, to feel the air on my face, and get my heart thumping a little.After listening, I only had one thing to say: as daily workout routines go, her daily dog-walk was right up the list in my book. It had both of the key components that make up sticky movement habits:She had a prompt, or trigger (her jumpy puppy), that came from outside of her. It was some extrinsic motivation, but--and this is important--not of the shame-y kind. Dogs are excellent at this unconditional kind of friendshipShe found regular pleasure in the habit. Rather than depending onlong-term payoffs as her motivation to go for the walk, she actually surprised herself by how much she enjoyed it each day.Taken together--with the motivation flowing to her from the outside AND inside--C had all the necessary ingredients for a long-term movement habit.And with that seed, more movement was not just a possibility but actually much more likely: a 20min walk could become 45 minutes of walking, joint mobility, and strength work in a few short weeks, with the right progression.But it was also working well for her just as it was; she had nothing to feel guilty about.We have all been sold a lie, when it comes to fitness and working out: that its supposed to feel bad, hard, almost repentant.Thats just not true.In fact, if and when you find a mode of moving that feels good, your ears should perk up a little: youve just found a nugget of gold to hold onto, write down, and capitalize on.The next step is to find the right external nudge (trigger) that will spur you to act on that pleasure-bringing move. This might be a fun accountability-pact with a friend or an easy schedule/logistical tweak (right when I wake up, right after I brush my teeth, while Im waiting for the tea to steep, etc).Or it could be framed as a service for someone outside of you: walking your dog (like C), playing with your kid, teaming up with your neighbors, or anything else.If theres any magic involved in fitness, its in combining the naturally-occuring parts of our astounding human nature into more of the stuff that matters most to us.Just like C needed a little nudge to realize that she had the makings of a superior movement habit already happening under her nose, it will take each of us some effort to find our particular formula simply because we are all incredibly, intrinsically unique.This is exactly the kind of self-work that we facilitate with our online classes and training, because we think anytime someone can improve their relationship to moving their body, their life feels better.What kind of habits are lying around in your life, hiding right under your nose?Id love to hear about em... I bet theres some gold there .To finding your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "Not sure if you saw this news tid-bit, but the US Senate is currently debating about confirming Deb Haaland as our new Secretary of the Interior.(Coach Will here! Stay with this one, I promise it connects to your relations with your bod read on!).If confirmed, she would be the first Indigenous person to serve in this capacity; in fact, shes the first Indigenous person to be nominated to a cabinet position.Ever.When I was reading this about her last week, I suddenly was swept over by a wave of heavy emotion.Here, for the first time in the 400+ years that Europeans (and their descendents) have arbitrarily laid claim to this continent, someone of Indeigenous descent is being lifted to power.I cant point to what (literally) chokes me up each time I read about her, but theres something about what it means to have her voice and her life experiences (Im not a stranger to the struggles many families across America face today. Ive lived most of my adult life paycheck to paycheck.) leading the decision-making about one of our most precious resources: land.As in, space.Room for beings to be. All of em/us.More and more, I am seeing how blocked humans become--emotionally, physically, spiritually--when they dont have room to move and explore and rest and start over and, and, and... be. In fact, many Indigenous activists have come to say that the only way to start healing the deep wounds caused by the Eurpoean genocide of Indigenous people is by literally returning ancestral land to tribes.Its already happening, in East Oakland (and elsewhere).This upswell of actual, tangible steps toward re-matriation of the land (and thereby starting the healing of cultural relationships as well) are inspiring to me.My identity (white, able-bodied, cisgendered guy from the suburbs) makes it hard for me--emotionally--to fully face the reality of what my life represents next to the lives of my Ohlone neighbors.But watching healing occur, led by Indigenous folx like Haaland, actually opens the door for me to see a glimpse of the living nightmare that ran on repeat for so many Indigenous people, for so many decades.Its this emotional block--which limits our ability to fully face what is going on around us--that resonated most with me, and reminds me of my work teaching people the magic of mobility-training. I recognized the powerful but often unseen force that keeps us from fully seeing ourselves. Its seldom about pure information or knowledge that is the gap. In my experience, its much more about gradually softening toward ourselves, and allowing for the idea that we ALL. NEED. SPACE. To exist.We need space in our schedule to dream and do nothing.We need space in our ego to allow for bright, shining achievements and failing.We need space in our kitchen for nourishing food of all types, including the tasty shit that doesnt serve any purpose beyond making us happy.We need space in our clothes to hold all of our bulky, bony bits, and extra room to allow for dancing.We need that as individuals, and our communities need that as well.So whether were making space in our joints, or in our schedules, relationships, or world-views, we can know that we are doing the very best thing for the overall system: allowing room for the magic to happen.Heres to hoping that by the time you read this, Deb Haaland is overseeing that kind of transition for our country from the highest levels of our government.Heres to finding your gold, Coach Will",

      "text": "Hey,This is Coach Will dropping by with an update from our world (tho that kinda undersells it, but I'll get there). Early on, I learned that the very best parts of life--the most alive, most creative, most rich--share a critical trait: they end.Unlike objects that persist even after they are thrown away, those most valuable aspects of our experience are so valuable exactly because they don't last forever.And so it is with the commercial lease of our studio.Thanks to Covid, a prolonged visit from the Wicked Witch of Plumbing Mishaps, and the clarity that came with dealing with both, Hannah and I decided (after much hand- and heart-wringing) that the best next step for The Fitness Alchemists was to leave the brick-and-mortar gym-owner life behind.This move leaves us with much more bandwidth to keep exploring the wide world of online movement/mobility coaching.Working with people in this way, oddly, has been a big bright spot of this last year.Being able to coach through an internet connection offers a closeness to our members' day-by-day movement life that was completely impossible when we only saw people in-person, and the results for our members have been undeniable.So while we will miss the way the morning sun warmed our mats, the spectacular backdrop our Stahl Wall provided for allll the filming, the community that was kindled inside those walls, and so much more, we look ahead to the shape of things to come.          All of the work and energy that went into crafting our space will still be composting for some time, but we can't wait to see what grows next. Thank YOU for being on this journey with us, and stay tuned And in the words of the one and only Coach Hannah: 'On we merrily stumble.'Go find your gold,Coach WillPS: Speaking of more bandwidth, we recently were able to upgrade our YouTube page a bit with new welcome vids and lots of free content.check it out, would ya? Wed love it if you hit Subscribe, but also we just wanna hear what you think!",

And if anyone says they are, thats#fatphobiatalking.Heres to loving our strong bellies in all their forms,Coach HannahP.S.

    "The Four Obstacles": {
      "text": "When Hannah and I meet (we have realized after many, many years of working together) we are as interested in the inspired, rambling tangents that we find ourselves exploring as we are in actually managing the nuts and bolts of our business.It was during one such tangent recently that we happened on an idea that completely changed my perspective about what we do as coaches.There are a lot of lessons tied up in this moment of realization--why collaboration is a critical part of any creative process, how inductive and deductive reasoning are both involved in finding shared truth, how staying on task is not nearly as useful as its chalked up to be--but here, now, Id like to just share the realization itself.Physicality is a birthright, central to what it means to be a human (or a squirrel, iguana, bacteria, etc), and movement is the main way we engage with that physicality.For this reason, and thanks to significant biological machinery that creates a powerful reward circuit, humans want to move--if they can.Weve believed this much to be true for some time, even though it flies in the face of most of the fitness industry. Remember, there are still many, many trainers who see physical activity as some sort of penance or tax that each of us have to pay...or else. (cue the doom music).<<shakes head>> Such bullshit.Movement is way, way more important than that. And much more fun.)Like gravity pulls us toward the ground, our physical make-up--our biology, neurology, genetics, and environment--pulls us toward movement. That pull can be interrupted in any number of ways, and when it is blocked severely enough that a person cant move how theyd like to, that person is blocked from realizing the expanse of their personal power.Our work as coaches is simply to help unblock our members from the four main ways that humans are blocked in their pursuit of movement.So what are those four obstacles??In no particular order, and with some definite overlaps, these obstacles can be summarized like this:Lack of Access: if the perfect movement outlet for a person requires being in a certain place, or if it costs too much, it simply will not work for someone. And thats not even close capturing how Lack of Access blocks movement for folx. In fact, when we zoom way out on this problem, making movement accessible is actually at the foundation of any/all solutions to help folx get moving how they want.Lack of Empathy: so many people we have worked with tell us horror stories about previous gym/trainer experiences, and those experiences almost always revolve around how those tasked with guiding them (their coaches, trainers, friends, whatever) actually shamed them or bullied them toward the goal. Beyond just sounding cruel and unnecessary, this kind of approach seems to ignore a simple truth: doing new or challenging things is emotionally hard, no matter your experience, background, or intended destination.Lack of Mobility: as in, a physical lack of space to move at one or more of your joints. This can (and does) literally limit the movements we can make; when we ignore these limits, we often pay the price with injury, pain, or frustration. Learning about and improving mobility is the piece of the equation that has become our bailiwick at The Fitness Alchemists, mostly because the tools involved are--somehow--quite far outside of the realm of expertise for most trainers.*Lack of Interest: when all of the other obstacles have been realized, acknowledged and worked through sufficiently to allow someone to live into their physicality, there still remains another block: people have to actually care about what theyre doing. I know--weird, right? If they are not interested or curious enough, they will eventually lose any drive to keep going (as an aside, this is why competition is SO powerful: it is supremely interesting--for *some* humans--to test themselves, over and over).This last obstacle in particular helps shed some light on why I can so confidently say that humans are driven toward moving their bodies.Movement is part of how we express our drive for understanding. When babies are born, they reflexively begin moving all of their parts, not in some pre-programmed set-up protocol, but actually just to explore their surroundings. Those surroundings are transmitted to their brain via sensory cells in their eyes, ears, nose, skin and--most significantly for our purposes--in their joints. And that sensory information is translated, over time, into a map of sorts for their brain to follow as that baby finds their place in the world.So when an arm waves, the baby is not just feeling the air with their hands but actually is mapping the physical possibilities for further exploration (If that babies nervous system was providing commentary, it might say something like Ooo, I can move my arm over *here*!)This same link--between curiosity about ourselves, our surroundings, our possibilities, and physical movement--is a central part of life for adults, too.In fact, if movement is really interesting, it will actually obscure the blockages caused by other obstacles (example: if I love playing soccer enough, it will be easier to ignore physical limitations in my ankle or hip).On the other hand, if movement is not interesting, it quickly becomes stale and starts to feel like busy-work--something you have to do, and not something youd like to do. We all know what that feels like.Theres much more to dig into in future newsletters, but Im going to pause there for now, because Im curious.Do you feel these obstacles present in your life? How do they manifest for you?Id love to hear from your nervous systems perspective .To finding your gold, Coach Will*which I can understand! It took us fully 1-2 years of practice and study--after already training for several years--to really implement the kind of training that truly builds mobility.",

      "text": "I am getting more and more frustrated with the fitness worlds obsession with goals. (Coach Hannah, here.)I know  its what hiring a trainer or a coach is supposed to be all about  achieving GOALS!But hear me out on this...We can only begin with the body, being, and schedule that you have right meowIf we start with a goal, and then work our way backward\" what tends to happen is that our \"first steps\" are much closer to Future You than to Current You.Which means those steps will be pretty lofty and inaccessible for Current You to execute.Like trying to keep pace with a grown-up's stride when all you've got are toddler legs.It's just unfair.What if, instead, you began by focusing on Current You?What if you spent some time each day -- just 10-15mins -- getting to deeply know Current You.(This free video is a great way to begin.)As you explore your current sitch, new things will get noticed.In the same way that when you explore a forest, you discover different trails, birds, patches of shade.New options will surface, and you'll have the opportunity to play withthem.Tomovein a new direction.You'll easily be able to take these new steps, because they are right under foot.The fitness industry at large is so enamored with #Goals, but Id like to nudge us in a different direction.Especially if you've done the goals thing a bunch, and it hasn't been what you'd hoped, I would love to talk to you about what an inside-out approach might feel like for you, Hannah.Shoot me a reply to this email, or book a free 20min callin my calendar.We're coaching virtually now, so wherever you are, we can be there to take those first under-your-nose steps with you.On we merrily stumble,Hannah",

    "Strength Is a Many-Splendored Thing": {
      "text": "Last weekend, I sniffed the air and decided: it was time to plant the spring seedlings.Its something I really love to do, gardening nerd that I am (Coach Will here).I took a distinctly unplanned approach this year, and just bought a bunch of happy little sprout-lets to fill in the gaps in my raised beds.(Im calling it the Well see! strategy, which feels much less weight-y than the detailed plans Ive drawn up in other years.)Anyway, as I finished up transplanting the last of the tiny basil plants, I suddenly noticed how delicately I was handling these fresh young herbs. I supported them so gently, barely grasping them at all, in fear of crushing their intensely fine roots or bruising their bright green stalks.As I finished up and patted the dirt around those same stalks, now jutting confidently out of the ground, I caught a whiff of their incredible perfume. All at once the vibrancy of late summer flashed through my brain, when they will be bush-like and laden with jewels of green leaves.The power of the smell, the strength of it, caught me off-guard. I wasnt prepared for this sudden reminder of basils essential, incredible part of my remembered life story.And thats how it is with strength, something I tend to think a lot aboutThe word--strength--tends to be thrown around like we all know exactly what it is. But in reality, it is many, many things.It can be the strength to lift hundreds of pounds from the ground up over your head.It can be the strength to keep going for hours, days, or decades.It can be the strength to tell the asshole to go away, or to leave the asshole behind.And it can be the strength of a single whiff of a tiny basil plant, strong enough to evoke powerful memories.Because strength as a concept is not about the measured size of the force, but about the impact of that force.This is why I wanted to write to you today.Its so easy to slip into a binary world--of right/wrong, strong/weak, able/disabled--and that arbitrary distinction does not serve any of us, actually.It only serves to make the world easier to think about, but doesnt bring us closer to reality.So while Hannah and I are excited, delighted even, whenever we get to work with people on getting stronger, we also see that stronger as . not just one thing.Instead, stronger is the way that person can become more effective at being themselves, and their strength will be as unique as their fingerprint.Because strength is a many-splendored thing.Heres to finding your gold,Coach Will",

      "text": "I just have to share this text I got from one of our newer members:You guys, I love the full CARs routine!! Super intense moments, but also it felt good to move through parts of my body I havent been using in a while. Im also cracking up and loving all the imagery: $100 bills, balancing cups of coffee, meat suit These are all really helpful.\"Julia started her Fitness Alchemy journey in our Getting Unstuck program last January.She is a full time mom of two, who was really struggling to find any time to move her body while playing mom, chef, homeschool teacher, and ALL THE OTHER ROLES that parents are being asked to play in these shelter-in-place times.Getting a text like this, from someone with so much on their plate, makes my little coaching heart SING.Theres a lot to unpack in this dense little nugget of love, so here goes:1. She called out that it felt GOOD to moveThis is so so so important  as humans we lean toward things that are pleasurable. If we want to make a habit stick, its gotta be good-feeling. Me & Willbelieve that movement can feel good AND help you get stronger, or faster, or better at whatever it is you want to do physically.Also: Helping folks wake up parts of themselves that have felt lost or disconnected is our JAM!Our vision?That every human has intimate connection to, and knowledge of, all parts of their physical beings.Were on a mission to maximize joyful movement (which we believe to be the birthright of all bodies)This sounds major, and it is, but it can start small. For example, in our Getting Unstuck program, we start with just 1 minute a day of intentional movement.2. She said our cues cracked her up AND were really helpfulThis means A LOT to me. Will and Iare deeply devoted to helping folks start up a two-way conversation with their bodies, so being good communicators is crucial to that mission.I want you to understand YOURSELF, without feeling like you have to study anatomy to do it.I also think laughter is an essential nutrient, both for general joy (again, pleasure is important, see #1) and for LEARNING. We remember shit we think is funny. We tune out when things are boring.3. The full CARs routine that she talks about is up for grabs on our YouTube channel.If you wanna grab you some of that goodness, head on over there and give it a twirl:Morning CARs Routine - 15 minutesIf 15 minutes feels like TOO MUCH, thats cool.And we respect that.Try this1 minute movement momentinstead.Even if you feel overwhelmed right now (super legit response to the current world sitch, btw)we would love to help you find connection to your body.It can be so grounding and resourcing tomove, and in that movement, experience yourself. As you are.Were here to help!xx,CoachHannah",

      "text": "Hey there,What if you were able to believe that already, right now, you are *doing it right*?What if you were able to be generous with yourself, and see the glass of your experience as half-full?What if the paths you see for yourself to PROGRESS or GROW were just *options* in front of a you that was already doing a great job?How would that shift your relationship with yourself?How would that relieve the constant barrage of 'SHOULD's and 'YEAH, BUT's that undercut you?How would that expand your world-view, and the moves you could make in that expanse?Now, this kind of thought experiment isn't some kind of believe-it-into-reality ploy, but rather just an idea to play with, and maybe to balance out the chorus of dissent that can dominate our inner worlds.I remember so clearly walking to class in college and realizing how loud the You SHOULD voices really were in my head.And I say voices because there were several, and they were arguing. Their messages conflicted, intertwining into so many dead-ends, and I was stuck in the middle trying to figure out what to do.It really felt like no matter what direction I took, Id be doing it wrong according to at least one of those SHOULD-y voices.And just like that, like a circuit shorting itself, I would be drained and confused simply by trying to satisfy all those critical voices.Now some years on from that realization, I still hear those voices all the times (yes, I hear voices ), but theyve been balanced out with other voices, that sound/feel more like gratitude (I attribute this change mostly to a long-term commitment I have to recognizing the good stuff in my life)The reality is that our lives, our bodies, our being is replete with natural miracles, miracles of sensation, of connection, of consciousness, of possibility and transformation.Our minds, on the other hand, can sometimes stagnate with an underlying belief that we are NOT doing it right.But what if, just for a moment, you were able to believe that actually, right now ... you are doing it right?Where would that inner conversation lead?Here's to finding your gold ,Coach Will",

      "text": "        Photograph: @Juansharks/Juan Oliphant/AFP/Getty Images    Hey friiiieeeend,So sometimes great analogies for fitness/training come up and smack you right in the kisser.Thats what happened recently for me.One fine May day, as I was scrolling my way through good ole YouTube I stumbled across a mini-doc about Great White sharks being kept in aquariums.It didnt go well.Literally every place they have tried it--no matter the size of the tank, the conditions, or the care taken to transport these ginormous fish--the shark hasnt lived for more than a ~year, but usually much less.Like days.Now putting aside for a second the morality (or lack) underpinning the cavalier way that humans always seem to be kidnapping, caging, and torturing-to-death animals (the bigger and more exotic the better!), aka our fellow earth-dwellers  As they began unpacking why these Great Whites were not able to survive while other bigger sharks and animals could, the documentary made it clear right away that all fish need water constantly flowing over their gills in order to breathe.But while some gilled creatures can suck water in and out across their gills, and therefore breathe while staying still in place in the water, Great Whites rely on locomotion--changing their location via movement--through the ocean to keep that oxygen a-flowin.They have to keep moving.As I thought back to this documentary a few days later, I realized that this is what Im coaching folx about all the time.Cause guess what, we humans have the same thing going on.Well--its not exactly the same our apparatus is different (lungs vs gills, arms vs fins, etc), and our medium is different (air vs water).But the principle really does overlap: we all need motion in order to access the physical nutrients required for life.We need it, its not a nice to have.Now how that movement happens, what it looks and feels like, what its for (sports? dancing? making sweet body music with your honey??)...all of it is up to you.Society will try to tell you, in obvious and covert ways, what the right kind of movement is for you. Plus, the physical context of your life--your work, your living situation, etc--will surely dictate the kind of movement you find on a regular basis.This human movement needcanbe, and often is, ignored;sometimes, life just doesnt feature enough movement for what a body needs.And theres no moral judgement about that, at least not from me.But over time, that turning away from our physical bodies results in a loss of connection with the very signal that prompts us to get moving.Its as if those sharks slowly lost the impulse to move, and therefore stopped breathingvoluntarily*. As if they suffocated themselves...Ok, ok, so dramatic, I know. But the point here is that this is a front a center-and-topic for almost everyone we work with, once we get down to the real grit.Which is why, along with educating folx about how to communicate clearly with their bodies, we at The Fitness Alchemists are interested in sparking that impulse to get moving.To tuning in to what movement really feels like, and how it really impacts us.How good it feels, how necessary.Go ahead try it reach your arms as far in front of you as you can, andn the over your head, and now behind you.See what I mean?Go find your gold,Coach Will*thats not exactly what happened in real life, but it works for my analogy!",

      "text": "Pop quiz! What is more important:Moving your body in ways that are fun, playful or invigorating?OrDoing the exercises that will ultimately make your body feel better?Trick question: the answer is BOTH.The more years I get under my belt, the clearer I am that finding the motivation to move is a balancing act between two essential movement nutrients:JOY + TENDING.We need to move in ways that bring us in-the-moment JOY. It's immediately rewarding and life-enriching. It helps us *feel* our bodies in a positive light.And, for most of us, there are parts of our bodies that are asking for some specific tending....an ankle that complains when we run...a tender low back that doesn't appreciate the high-octane kitchen dance party we got up to last night...wrists that aren't ready to support our bodyweight...a hip that aches after a long daya stiff neck that interrupts our focus when we try to write (oh hey, thats me!)These parts that need tending can change, and they are going to need:- specific inputs, to invite the adaptation that we want- consistent inputs, over enough timeaka patience & devotion.What we have found is that it doesn't work to completely put movement-joy on hold, while we \"fix\" the part(s) that need tending.It takes too long, and we lose sight of what its all for.Connecting with activities that you love -- that bring that joyous sparkle -- help us feel motivated to actually *do* the tending stuff.The Tending, in turn, opens up more avenues for Joy.It's a virtuous cycle.So Im curiousHow are you accessing embodied JOY these days? What are you TENDING to in your body?In your corner,Hannah",

    "What Would You Do?": {
      "text": "One of my all-time favorite nerd-tastic words is 'affordance'.According to trusty wikipedia, 'affordances are what the environment offers the individual'.It's such a great way of describing the profound ways that we compliment our environment, being shaped by our surroundings even as we shape those very surroundings.An affordance is that window ledge that offers you the perfect lookout perch, that 5-gallon bucket that, when flipped over, transforms into a perfect drum, and also that pesky crack in the sidewalk that you subconsciously change stride to accommodate.Great designers think about the way that products 'afford' their users certain possibilities, as do urban planners, architects, and sports scientists.In each realm, the fact that humans use direct awareness of environmental cues to shape their understanding of the world--and their unique possibilities within that world--means that if you can change someone's environment, even subtly, you can definitively change their life.As a fitness coach, focused on how to impact the internal environment of bodies, I also see this interaction between a person and their environment at play when they access MOAR movement options (by expanding the usable range of motion of their joints).Suddenly, that too-high-to-reach-shelf is not so high when your shoulder allows your arm bones to go alllllll the way behind your ear.Suddenly that low cupboard where you keep your big stock pot is not a job for hands-and-knees, not when you have a hip that allows you to squat or lunge down to grab it.Suddenly that too-steep-for-my-knees bike ride is not just doable but down right exhilarating (that's what's going on in the pic above--photo cred to the inimitable @true_spokes )Of course, this 'sudden' re-orientation within our environments is not necessarily quick--the work of changing our tissues to accommodate more stable movement is substantial, and takes persistence.But the pay-off can be life-changing.How would your world change if your joints afforded you even 5% more access to your movement dreams?- Coach Will",

      "text": "The M word (motivation) is like... 90% of the reason most people hire a trainer, or sign up for a class-based membership.As such, It's something Will and I put a lot of thought into.(Coach Hannah here, hayyyy!)There's a couple things I want to straight-up normalize:Motivation to move your body fluctuates.So if that's you, you're normal. You're not failing. There's nothing wrong with you.I repeat:There is nothing wrong with you, if you don't roll out of bed every single day STOKED to move your body.I sure dont. And I am a coach & movement professional.Trust me  I sometimes judge myself pretty harshly for not having that get-up-and-go energy every single day.I hear from my clients, and I feel in myself, a yearning to solve the motivation problem for good.Heres the real T: I dont know that this is a realistic desire.The kind of motivation that can stoke a lifetime can't be single-sided or one-size-fits-all. We humans are too variable, and life is too random.That long-haul motivation needs to be something that has polarity to it, so it can flex with us as things shift.I talked about this last week, and I'm gonna keep saying it, cuz I really think we are on to something here.Motivation that is rooted in our own autonomy is a balance between:JOY + TENDINGMovement practices flourish and motivation simmers in variable yet steady supply when these two polarities are present.Joyfulmovement is its own reward  you might need more of this element when you are burnt out, stressed, or just dont have the capacity to focus on one. more. thing.Tendingmovements unlock more possibilities for joyful movement, but they take a bit more focus & specificity. (Often they bring some amount of immediate relief, which can also be rewarding.)How might your movement practice (and motivation to move) shift, if you invited yourself to blend these two elements in the right ratio for you, ON ANY GIVEN DAY?If you allowed yourself to be variable, to show up to practice as you are, and met yourself lovingly with the right mixture of Joy + Tending?Have you had a time in your life when you felt like you were both...Tending to the parts that need more strength, more resilience, more flexibilityand...Joyfully moving your body in ways that felt playful, exploratory, exciting, and/or great for your mental health?It could begin with just 10mins a day of each. Or even 5mins of each. Or 5 and 10. Or 45 and 5. As we always say in our Kinstretch classes, its a variable to play with!If motivation has been a challenge for you, I've love to hear how this concept is landing for you.In your corner,Coach Hannah",

      "text": "Heyyyyythere,Coach Will here, and Im writing to you from the roadColorado to be exact. AndI keep pinching myself.After more than a year of clinging tightly to my home, and my routines, as a sanctuary from Covid but also an anchor for this wild year, me and my girlfriend hit the road.We left Oakland 5 days ago and shot like an arrow across the rippling dead heat of Nevada and through the endless red canyons of Utah.Going a bit slower over the Rockies, in deference to elevation that made our car (and us) pant a bit, it struck me that the same sense of safety and sovereignty I had clung to in Oakland was still firmly within my grasp.It feels different than all the other road trips Ive ever taken, more free, more spontaneous, more loose but also more satisfying.Because rather than just a way of getting between points by car, this time thejourneytruly feels like the point of the trip.What a gift.See, in the past when Ive travelled, the slow pace involved in actually getting to the destination had to be mitigated (I thought) by a constant bustle of activity.Could I sneak in a workout before or after driving for the day?Could I piece together a healthy meal from truck stop snacks?Could Isomehowtake in allthe attractionsandstay on schedule?In each scenario, could I manage to work toward my goalsandbe present for whatever magic the road had to offer?No.I couldnt, though I tried, and tried, and triedIt was always a let-down because (I realize now)I was trying to live two lives at once.One life was the achiever, the habit-keeper, the version of myself that seemed most virtuous.And the other was the traveler, the observer, the version of myself who could be at peace with myselfmy body, my abilities, my trajectoryto bechangedby the world around me.And as I reflect on this tendency of mine, I realize that this is yet another manifestation of the message that we Fitness Alchemists push so adamantly:it isworththe labor to get into friendship with yourself, starting with your body.Becauseas you do(for its an on-going process, continuously unfolding), you begin to realize that everything you needto feel safe, grounded, and ready for adventureis righthere, built right into your incredible biology.So wherever you, and whatever you're up to this summer, I'll invite youagain and againtobefriend your body.In your corner,Coach Will",

    "Why is power washing so satisfying?": {
      "text": "My friend came through town and stayed the night with us this week. (Coach Hannah, here, feeling really grateful for those covid vaccines!)As the evening wore on, we got to talking about pandemic home maintenance, and how she had recently power washed her own house.Its so satisfying! Her face sparkled with delight as she relived the memory. You can see, oh this looked likethis, and now it looks like THAT.She is a filmmaker (sometimes writing, producing, and directing) and most of the projects she works on take 4+ years to come together  before anyone actually gets to see them.Thats a looooong time to have to stay engaged with something and not get to witness the full fruits of your labor.So the first thing she did when she got home from her last shoot?Power wash her house. AKAapply some focused effort, which was rewarded with immediate and obvious change.What was dirty, now is clean. Yum!So how does this relate to your body and movement?Lets feel it out together, shall we?Try this with me right now  raise your arm to at our above chest height. Place you hand on a door frame or a wall, and then gently turn your chest (aka t shirt logo) away from the arm on the wall until you find a stretch.Now, hold that stretch and breathe for a few moments to get clear on where exactly you feel it.Ok now, dont move, but start pressing your hand into the surface as though you are trying to bring your arm back in front of your chest. Gently. This should feel like it lights up (or engages) the muscles that are stretching.Hold that gentle effort for a few breaths, then slowly release it.If you then felt your stretch get less intense, or you felt you were able to turn your chest farther away from the arm on the wall, youve just power washed your chest-shoulder-arm stuff.The change you feel is neurological  its your central nervous system rewarding you with a little more freedom to move because you expressed strength at length. Its immediate, but also temporary.These immediate changes are super rewarding  its like brain candy! However, they are temporary.Changes in strength, stamina, and I-woke-up-like-this flexibility take time.Theres no way to power wash those things into being.I do think its helpful to give ourselves power washing opportunities where we can  because it can help us feel good, and recommit to the longer haul projects we are working on.When you think about your body, your physical abilities and expressions, what is the long-term change that is important to you?Where could you infuse some immediate gratification into the process?Id love to help you think through these questions.In devotion to our resilience,Hannah",

    "The Space Between": {
      "text": "How do you relate to the space between where you are and where you want to be?Looking at that gap makes most of us uncomfortable. I know it makes me reeeeeal squirrely. (Coach Hannah, here.)I want to ignore it, but it cant really be ignored because once you see it, you cant un-see it.So I do the next best thing: I try to cover it up  so that no one else sees it  while I frantically busy myself (behind the scenes, of course, because again, NO ONE CAN KNOW) trying to close the gap as quickly as possible.But what Im noticing is that this whole cover-up hurry-up change-before-anyone-else-realizes-youre-not-where-you-want-to-be game is exhausting. And, it means Im alone with it. No one else gets to help.If this past year of the pandemic has taught me anything, its this: I can rely on myself more than I thought, and also: I need help.So how do you look at that space between where you are and where you want to be?Are you able to see its full scope and stay grounded?Can you look at your Current Self with kindness, even as you see clearly the Future You youre moving towards?Are you keeping this change effort all to yourself, even hiding it from others?Could you identify a few trusted friends or allies who could share the journey with you?It can be super scary to let others in on that space.It means revealing that we arent yet who we hope to be, and that takes a lot of courage.But in my experience, letting the right people see me, and be with me in my struggle, shifts the tide.Sometimes just being witnessed by someone who cares can make a difficult moment so much easier to bear.So many folks Ive spoken to this past week are realizing that they havent moved their bodies as much as they would like to during these Covid times. Myself included! The aches and pains have increased over the past year, the sense of strength has slipped out of our fingers. The routines and habits we relied upon in the Before Times were off limits, and now some are an option again but maybe things have shifted and there is no back to normal.If youre feeling the physical toll the pandemic has taken on your body, I just want to lift up that you arent alone. And you dont have to be with that space between how your body feels now, and how youd like it to feel, all by yourself.We are all climbing out from under this Pandemic rock together. We are all navigating an unprecedented experience.If you need someone to help you look kindly at your Space Between, and be there with you as you wade in and start to move forward, we are just a few key strokes away. Our virtual membership puts me and Will with you in your pocket, plus youll be joining a community of folks all over the country who are on their own journeys of befriending their bodies.To our resilience,Hannah",

    "Your Nervous System Knows": {
      "text": "Well helllloooo there!Coach Will stoppin by to say hey, and letting you in one of the biggest keys that I know when it comes to training your body, yet one that is SOOOO easy to lose sight of: respecting your nervous system.See, it doesnt matter how awesome the workout is... if your nervous system isnt feeling safe, youre gonna be stopped at a red light.No matter how much you might *want* a certain movement or position, if your body isnt feeling safe--a bottom baseline--its really not worth pushing through. Not for one more set, one more inch of stretch, one more rep.Instead, youll need to zoom on how to proceed with a little LESS.And the way your body lets you know to STOP (and adjust) is as diverse and varied as we humans are, tho fortunately there are some common overlaps that clue us in... pain trouble breathing calmly limbs falling asleep general feelings of anxiety even dizziness/nausea.In each case, your body is doing its best to send physical signals that while its *possible* to go further, it likely wont go so well.This gets especially tricky when you actually feel like you NEED a certain position to get your workout in--like that shoulder shape to hang from a bar, or that hip shape to squat down low.Which is why we are continuously reminding our students that you gotta hunt out *your* range, *your* positions, that allow you to feel safe, solid and ready to *work*.Going beyond that--disrespecting your Current You--is a short-term play that doesnt serve Future You.Luckily, there is another way, and it allllll starts with getting a sense of where your safe zone actually is at each joint.Yes, Im talking--again--about CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations). If theyre new for you, try some out on your body.Then, once you get into that open, respectful conversation with your bod, your next steps become much, MUCH more clear:shore up any spots that need some love (aka more range-of-motion, more control or strength, etc)choose fitness movements that work WITHIN your useable ranges, and dont push past the zone that your nervous system is happy with.This can be a tricky concept to get the hang of, mostly because it is SO outside the mainstream fitness world (which tells us to suck it up and push through those STOP signs).But the payoff is worth it when you start to feel how a happy, secure, and trusting nervous system lets you move.In your corner,Coach Will",

      "text": "Ive been traveling this past week, and holy wow is it interesting to notice how a change in scenery and company affects my routines.This is coach Hannah, writing in from across the globe!Last Wednesday, my partner and I packed up our carry-on luggage, swallowed our covid-related travel anxiety, and flew to the magical, tropical island of Saint Lucia for family wedding.After a 2+ years without any international travel, we ripped the bandaid off and went allllllll the way to a tiny island off in the Caribbean.Needless to say, its been a bit over-stimulating!Being in an unfamiliar place, and being with a group of 10+ people we know, has been wonderful and overwhelming and just SUCH a contrast to the last year and a half of isolation at home.And guess what?It was way easy to just not do my usual movement practice.Sure, I kept up with my bare essentials  CARs every day  but I found myself getting them in at random times, as an afterthought, and mostly because my body didnt feel so great.Yeahhhh I have felt stiff and achey this week.My inner critic was quick to chime in: Ah-HA! Youre not a competent movement professionalyoure a FAILURE.I felt myself start to shrink and crumple into a pile of grossed-out grumpiness.And then, another voice chimed in: Isnt it cool that your body can ask for movement so clearly?Which got me thinkingWhy am I so quick to judge myself as a complete failure the moment my body feels uncomfortable?When I feel foggy-headed, and my tummy rumbles, I see those as clear signs that Im hungry and that it istime to eat something. I dont get all tangled up in self-judgement that I feel hungry I simply respond to that request and eat a frickin' snack.Ill even eat a sub-par snack or meal, just to get my focus back on track. When it comes to food-hunger, Im totally willing to let good enough be good enough. (Especially while traveling.)But when I feel achey and stiff  the clear signs of movement-hunger  its different somehow. Maybe you do this too?I dont tend to just reach of the easiest movement-snack, just to get something in my system.Instead I berate myself for getting into this situation in the first place and plan out an Epic Return To The Movement Practice Of My Dreams.Which of course is daunting, and doesnt usually go very well.As anyone who has tried to cook an epic gourmet meal on an already 2 hours empty stomach knows, its no way to set yourself up for success.When it comes to food hunger, I usuallyhave to have a quick snack, just so I can focus on cooking the actual meal.But when it comes to movement-hunger, I dont.So I decided that Im going to apply this snack before meal strategy with my movement starting today. I invite you to do it with me, if youd like.Im going to pepper in more of the easiest stuff to reach for  the convenient quick-grabs of movement that feel good, and settle my movement-stomach, as it were.For me that will look like: extra CARs for the parts that feel crummy. For you, it might look different.The key is to give your body a quick snack to stave of the hanger.If youre curious about CARs, we haveafree videoon our YouTube page you can snack on. Its only 16mins. Or you can munch on some even shorter snacks we put out on Instagram.This one is 6mins, and kicks off a whole series of shorties in the 3-7min range. Oh, and you don't have to have an Instagram account to see them, just click on the link and check 'em out in your web browser.Heres to nourishing our bodies, and learning to respect and respond toalltheir hunger cues,Coach Hannah",

    "What Fatphobia Steals From YOU": {
      "text": "Hey friend,As I am learning, the fight against fatphobia anddietcultureis many things, but one of the most critical pieces is realizingthat 'losing weight' or 'getting thinner' (or really any body-shaping intent)isnotworthsettling foras a driver for getting movement into yourlife.The way our bodies gain or loseweight are like the tides, coming in and out due to complexintersections of context, circumstance, genetics, and life experience.But--and this is key--its not aboutmorality.Yourworth as a person is simply not related to the size of your body. Period.And since theres nothing separating good people from bad based on their body shape, spending your life (and your savings) on trying to change it into a particular version that matches more closely the kind of body everyone sees on TV is quite simply  not worth it.Instead, you could spend your energy on:climbing mountainsseeking out new physical sensations (of strength, pleasure, relaxation, etc)foraging for or cooking tasty foodbuilding furnitureracing bikes, or pigeonswhatever the HECK you wantSee I believe that everyone has their own particular raison to move, and that it takespatience and sensitivityto figure it out what it is, for *you*.And asyou do (and itisa process of uncovering), alll the pieces fit: you findjoyand motivationin simplydoing the thing, you findconnection and meaning with other peoplewho connect with that same physical practice, and yourhealth(also anindividual, special blend for each person) magically improves.Hell, maybe even your body changes shape, but at this pointyou dont care. You care much more about how you can workwithyourbody to move inyourspecialwaythan how you can simply alter how it looks.And ... youll likely still have days you feel shitty about your body (we all do), abouthow you look, how you feel, how capable you perceive yourself to be...But overshadowing alllll of that, overwhelming you with gratitude about how magical your body is, will be those lovely movement experiences that scratch YOUR particular itch toget moving.Now here's the rub:you wont ever realize that special intersection ofexperience, movement, and emotionuntil youset down the tired (andbaseless, andunscientific, andcostly) code that says we all need to look like a magazine cover.Cuz we all need something much, much more important than that; we need our own, personal reason to move.Sowhat moves you?- Coach WillPS: If you're curious about how you could actuallywork onuncovering your own movement motivationoutside of the diet culture paradigm,do me a favorand let me know by replying to this email, k?I'm thinking about running a 5-ish week (online)program specifically focused on this topic in the fall, and would love to know if you'd like to be part of it.",

      "text": "There is an incredible carpentry tradition in Japan, founded largely upon creating structures and furniture with jointswhere edges of wood come togetherthat dont use any nails, screws or glue.Instead, they rely on and apply ancestral knowledge regarding the shape of strong connection points, and build incredibly stable structures largely by making very precise cuts, by hand.Now |FNAME|, I wanted to to tell you about this today because it has a deep connection to how we can approach our bodies in a different, and I think better, way than main stream culture would have us do. This is a longer one, but its been brewing for a while sostick with me :).In addition to being as effective, and sometimes *more* effective, as modern Western carpentry methods (using metal and glue), the result is stunningly beautiful.          I was first captivated by this art/craft/culture after college, when I found myself living in a small town on the Western brim of Massachusetts. It was as hot and humid that summer, and the only thing going in town was the library, where I stumbled upon the classic, The Art of Japanese Joinery.The 10yr-old in me flipped, and I fell into a deep and abiding fascination with how something so simpleessentially wooden blockscould be assembled into everything from tiny, jewel-like boxes to sweeping temple roofs that have stood for 400 years, outlasting many more modern buildings.I learned about the guilds that had carefully cultivated these secrets.I learned about the careful forestry and harvesting they did of the trees, so that the eventual structure built from a certain tree would actually become stronger, tighter, as it aged.But I became most engaged by the tools of the trade.Seeforegoing modern materials wasnt the only way Japanese carpenters didnt conform; they also maintained an almost holy obsession with their simple, mechanical implements of their predecessors: handsaws, chisels, mallets and lines of string for marking straight lines.*One night, as I randomly perused Japanese carpentry articles online, I finally read about what it was like to be a carpentry apprentice.Heres how I remember itApparently, at first, they just have you sweep the floor. For about 6 months. Very clean.Then, they begin to teach you about sharpening the saws, some of which are 100+ years old. 100s of saw teeth. Sharp.If youre still there after a couple years of sharpening saws, theyll graduate you up to the planes, and then finally the chisels which do much of the final joint-shaping. Make them Very Sharp.After 5 years, they begin to teach you the way that you cut and shape wood into joints, and then its several more years (like 10+) before becoming a master.The more I learned, the more it became clear that the sharpening of knives was not just a tortuous initiation process to weed out casual hobbyists.No, it functioned as an indoctrination into the essential, fundamental mind-set of a carpenter, and it informed everything they did.After 5 or more years of simply sharpening tools, I imagine that one must come around to appreciating this subtle act.They must form a connection with these precious, inanimate objects, and how to best conjure a sharp, cutting edge.And then, as they learn how to wield them on the precious, natural gift that is a dead tree, these students of the steel realize that all their their dedication to sharpening is now coming back to them in the form of steady cuts and straight edges.Over and over and over, steady cuts and straight edges.No machines are needed when a master craftsman is wielding a sharp blade over a clean, hand-selected board.Now for the analogy to our bodies that I have endlessly pondered since that sweaty Massachusetts summer what is the valiant, daily act that we might do for ourselves that best compares to a carpenter sharpening their blades?What will not just make us sharper, but actually more capable of doing our craft and making our work?What action/s will hone our bodies into the most true version of ourselves, the most effective and joyful version?What beliefs will we need to hold onto, amidst all the bullshit swirling around, and what will we need to ignore?And finally, what attitude will we take to our work, and what will our work inspire us to do next?The underlying connection is that the work of our livesbe it physical work or just, you know, the fact our lives occur inside a PHYSICAL BODYwill always be the result of our ability to use our tools,And the tools of living in a body are our joints. Our knees, and shoulders and all the rest.Thats rightin the world of movement, which is our world, our joints are the fundamental way that we get through. It is how we go toward the things we want, and go away from those we dont.Its how we grow, and how we multiply.Our joints are the carpenters chisel, our saw, that we use to construct the work of our dreams: our lives.This is why I am so adamant about spending the little time that we each day to moveat least some of iton sharpening our joints, on making our movement-parts work a little better.What would you make with joints that cut a straighter path to where you wanted to go?-Coach WillPs: If youre curious about what a Daily Sharpen might look like for you, reply to this email with SHARP in the subject line and lll send you a Kinstretch class to try out. You gotta feel it to believe it*No power saws, no drill presses, and most of the work was done on the ground. I knowWHAT?!",

    "Saying \"yes\" to the Unknown": {
      "text": "I was verrrrry lucky to do a little international travel this past month, and visit the Amalfi coast of Italy. (Coach Hannah here -- ciao!)It reminded me that we always need a little more bandwidth than we planned for!That ridge that is silhouetted against the setting sun in this picture?          Yeah, we hiked out to the end of that peninsula, and down down down to a beautiful cove, where we swam in the clear aqua blue water with alllllllll the fishes.The water was so cool, and there were so many incredible nooks to explore teaming with sea life, that we stayed later (and swam more) than we'd planned.Then (womp womp) the hike back up was steeper than I'd imagined it would be on the way down, and it was HOT -- and we ran out of water less than half way up.At that point, the only thing to do was to get back to the top, where we had more water in the car.We adjusted our pace to go more slowly (especially so we could linger a little longer in the patches of shade along the trail).Slowly, steadily, we made it.It was a good reminder that a great adventure will often ask a bit more of your body than you thought.I also remember thinking, while navigating the steepest rockiest most uneven \"stairs\" I've ever climbed, oh yeahhhhh THIS is why I do #Kinstretch!\"To give my joints a bit MORE range than they need in my every-day-life.So that there's room for random.So that I can say YES to the unknown.Im curious, FIRSTNAME, what would you like to be able to say yes to physically?Do you trust your body to stretch and strain and come out the other side in one piece? We would love to help you build that trust.Body trust is something that belongs to everyone. Regardless of your size, your age, your ability, or how athletic you consider yourself (or were told you are by someone else).I trust you to know if its time for us to work together on this quality. Ill be here.Andiamo,Hannah",

    "The Right Shorts": {
      "text": "For how much I now love to ride my bike, I will never forget the laughably simple thing that unlocked this love in me: having the right clothes.Now why am I telling you about probably the least cool-looking part of my wardrobe? Because nested inside this experience is an important lesson, and one that could help you, too. Read onI had ridden my bike on and off since I was a kid, but my interest would inevitably wane as I confronted the limits of my endurance. Basically, after a few longer rides, Id grasp how consistent Id need to be with my training to really move to another level, where longer rides felt doable and fun.And Id stop.But then my old buddy Max came by for a ride, and we got to chatting. Hes always been a serious cyclist, and as a semi-pro had more cycling clothing (kits in biker parlance) than he could use. So he sent me some.A few weeks later, as I unboxed the random assortment of padded shorts and slinky jerseys it dawned on me how much my biking efforts in the past were limited simply by the fact that Id run out of the right gear.Id go for a few rides and then run out of clean clothes. And that would be enough to knock me off my momentum.It feels ridiculous to write, but if youve ever ridden for more than a half-hour on a bike seat you KNOW how much a difference the right shorts make. Without them, your nethers immediately start barking at you; with them you dont even think about your seat until long after everything else has gotten good and tired.Since receiving that shipment of bike clothes about 16 months ago, I have ridden my bike nearly 7,500 miles. Suffice to say, Ive been able to keep my biking momentumAnd herein is the lesson: sometimes the most basic-seeming change can unblock you in ways you never imagined.Now lets be honest: most of the time, getting new clothes wont prompt a big change in behavior. But the right new thingbe it equipment, or a routine, or informationat the right time can completely change the challenge youre facing.Theres the you BEFORE the something, and the you AFTER it, and theyre distinctly, definitely changed in some powerful way.Id guess this happens most often with the right information: getting a key shred of info at the right time, when youre ready for it, can unlock you in a way that will never stop feeling miraculous.In that spirit, I want to leave you with an ask: what do you MOST want to know about mobility, or training, or fitness?Id love to address your questions in upcoming newsletters, and maybejust maybeit will prove to be that key for you that changes everythingIn your corner,Coach Will",

    "So\u2026What is the TFA membership?": {
      "text": "Since we closed the studio and stopped offering in-person classes, weve been asking ourselves this question A LOT.The Fitness Alchemists membership now exists online and not in a physical space, though it centers physical movement practice, which is different, to say the least.While trying to come up with a snazzy-snap answer to the question: What is your membership? I realized that, at its core, our membership is a place for asking questions, and living our way into the answers.Questions likeWhat does it mean to live in right relationship with our bodies?What does a movement practice rooted in #RadicalSelfLove feel like?What shape does it take?What does it ask of us?What happens when we un-grip the fearful fist of controlling our weight?When we unsubscribe from the never-ending newsfeed of fatphobia?What blossoms when we befriend our bodies?What would cycles of tending to our bodies look like, when we put down perfectionism and allow for consistency to ebb + flow?Where does motivation to move come from?What if joyful movement was considered a must-have, not a nice-to-have?These are the kinds of questions we welcome in our virtual membership space.Will and I are not here to provide Absolute Answers, but rather to stir the pot of communal inquiry, such that each of us might distill our own truth.And yeah, we offer some awesome movement stuff:Weve got a slammin library of on-demand classes.We can help you create a custom movement-practice container that supports your body to expand the capacities that matter to YOU  strength, flexibility, stamina, balance, coordination.Were planning some rad online workshops (well keep you posted on those!)But the real Fitness Alchemists are you all  the members of this online community, not us.Were here to facilitate you finding your gold.Were actively recruiting for Team Alchemy  if these questions stir a longing in you, I hope youll join us.The culture shift in fitness we seek to make needs your voice, your unique inquiry, your kernel of knowing.Read more about the nitty-gritty of how the membership works HERE, and hit me up with questions HERE.We love questions (obvi).In devotion to our resilience,Hannah",

      "text": "I am continuously reminded of the importance of that simple invitation to let in the world.Read on for my opinion (Coach Will with my philosopher hat on today)So much of the drive to use modern technology is about patching up the gaps in our experience quotathat amount of interest, engagement, curiosity, *motive* that imbues our lives when we humans feel fulfilled.As modern life features far less of the life-or-death struggles that our fulfillment feeling actually evolved in response to, we have opted instead for risk-free, disposable experiences that leave us unharmed, yes, but also unfulfilled.But I have found, over the last couple years, that there is actually a lot more going on right beneath our noses that canand perhaps shouldprovide our lives with a level of interesting that might actually scratch the itch we all have to lead fulfilling lives.Now first offLate-stage capitalism has failed us all. The billionaires are morally destitute, the middle class is watching the last few escape hatches toward wealth (aka fulfilment as capitalist define it) shoot away, and the legions of the worlds subsistent poor grow more numerous every day. Oh and the planet is teetering, already falling apart from our abuse and headed for much worse. Sure we live a bunch longer than our ancestors, but at the cost of meaning and community, of gratitude and connection. The notion that US-style capitalism is the global model for a more peaceful, just world seems to be thoroughly debunked at this point.All of which is to say: just trying to make a bunch of money and find happiness down that route is, based on history, not a great play if fulfillment is our goal.But one side-effect of this failed economic system has been the advent of social media, and the fine art these companies have made of attention-hijacking, perfecting the shiny-but-fake aesthetic. The impact of this tech is significant: never before in the history of the world has any individual or organization been able to predict who we are and what we will do next *better* than the social networks that hold us all in their thrall.Further, that thrall has blunted our ability to pay attention, making us progressively worse at experiencing what is real, out there in the world.Behind the veil of shiny-but-fake, aka when you put your phone in the drawer, the events that blossom have the potential to strike us, to leave an impact and make our lives rich, if we let them.If you can begin to shift into seeing this world, more and more deeply, the meaning we all seek is actually  right there.Doing dishes without any other stimulation is a sudsy, warming ritual.Resting after your day by examining the paint on the ceiling becomes a memorable moment with your cat.Asking your kid (or your nephew, or your partner) hard questions, and sticking in for the responses, the triggers, the defensiveness and the love underlying it all, ends up as a high-point of your month.See, great experiences *are* about risking your safety, but they neednt be life-or-death. Great, fulfilling moments are everywhere, all the time, if you leave yourself vulnerable to them. They need air, and space, a void to fill. So when we fill all the gaps in our lives by going slack-jawed on social media, there is nowhere for those exceptional moments to enter, so they dont. And sounfulfilledwe keep scrolling.Now: this email is *not* about judging your use (or MY use) of social media as bad or wrong. I only ever want you to do you, not to mention that I actually believe social media has been the theater for some of humanitys better moments.But this email IS about examining that use, and noticing what it keeps from you. What happens when there is less stimulation and more spaaaaaaace?Ill meet you there -Coach WillPs: A physical practice and attention are inextricably linked, which means the impact of deepening your physical practice can be profound for building your attention.

We have a mile-long to-do list of all the things we are going to change/work on/improve/addBut is there a list of what we appreciate  the things that already are going well?I want to invite us (and I mean US, cuz Im gonna do it too) to take a little time to reflect and write about what we appreciate about our bodies, or our care practices regarding our bodies  or both! Set a timer for 2 minutes and free-write whatever comes to mind in response to these two questions:What do I appreciate about my body?In what ways am I already doing a great job taking care of my body?By simply taking time to reflect on what we appreciate and give ourselves credit for what we are already doing well, we amplify those things.If youd like, you can send me your answers (ya know, if it will help you DO the writing to know that someone who cares about you will read it) but the most valuable part is actually you writing it down for yourself.Give yourself some credit. You deeply deserve it, I promise. Your fan,Hannah",

    "Doing Right By (All Of) You": {
      "text": "This idea has been following me around all week.First, it came up while talking to a client who has truly suffered from knee pain, as she shared the infectious joy shed witnessed watching her young niece fold up like a pretzel.Then, it got repeated at my volunteer gig yesterday when the random, masked stranger working next to me mentioned that hed wished hed taken better care of his joints before it was too late.And then the oracle of Instagram smacked me over the head with it as I scrolled lets just say the algorithm works.The idea is this: No more pain is not really a goal, but more of an avoidance, and a legitimate one at that. But letting pain be our only goal ignores fully half of ourselves. Our bodies are not built to just avoid things (like pain); we need to want things, too.These days, wanting so easily carries a materialistic flavor, and brings to mind the things that we want.But Im talking about the feelings that we want.The sensations, the experiences, the connections and realizations.The awakenings, and the particular affirmations of the fact that we are physical creatures.Im talking about those events that happen to us, in real time, that we seek out and make us feel the fact: I EXIST.This tiny seed of a being and feeling alive, of realizing our selves, lives inside every single human, no matter their body, their age, their abilities or limitations. Its like a tiny flame, the most fundamental flame, and it is called: curiosity.So when we ask that question, of how we want our lives to feel, and we are able to settle into a state of curiosity, we are tapping intoand often tapping back into, after a long-while awaya well of energy and interest, of motivation and excitement, about nothing more than the reality that we have bodies.Our lives are embodied, and that is non-negotiable.As I write this, Im realizing that saying it this way might shed some light on why Hannah and I focus, in these emails, so extensively on the subjective experience of having a body, of being inside the experience, and not objectively understanding it intellectually.Put simply, we will always encourage you to ask yourself: What does it feel like to be in MY body?Now, this can get murky in the sense that the subjective realm is a place that science has trouble touching. It is impossible to be both the subject of observation and an unbiased observer.Which makes pain a very tricky thing to peel apart. Painspecifically your painis a real thing that no one else can truly know.So when I hear from clients (and strangers) that pain has dictated their lives in ways small and largeand I try to feel into that heavy emotional burdenI am NOT going to only focus on mitigating their pain.Instead, I am most interested in first, validating their experience, and then asking them the same question Ill ask you nowWhat physical experiences do you want?Rooting for you,Coach Will",

      "text": "Why do you always leave a little on your plate?He asked, after dinner.I could tell it really confused him. (Coach Hannah here)Why would I leave a bite and a half of food behind, making for a more complicated clean-up, when surely, I could have fit those morsels into my stomach, even if I was feeling full?I get that logic. For convenience sake, a clean plate IS easier.But for me, that left-behind-bite though small, is a big rebellion against my conditioning around finishing food NO MATTER WHAT.Its part of a bigger commitment Im engaged in: learning to trust myself over others.Leaving unfinished food on my plate is one way I practice hearing and honoring my no so that I can tune into and hear my yes.It can be so hard to tell what is truly a YES in our bodies, especially with something like food. Most of us have been told what and how much and how often since we were little. Diet culture tells us that we cant trust ourselves to know the answers to what/how much/when/how often. Weve been taught that we need to follow rules and guidelines from experts.Unwinding the conditioning that Others know better than Self is difficult work. It feels edgy and weird and inconvenient. It feels lonely, at times, and in those moments I find myself feeling so grateful for my coach, and the small circle of friends who do get it.I want to widen that circle. I want to make one that transcends physical location, so that no matter where you are in the world, you can connect with folks who get what youre up to. Because I believe that it is vital for us to cultivate deep trust in ourselves. It is vital that we learn to tune into our own bodies and get familiar with what no and yes feel like physically.Are you practicing anything that feels edgy and tender? Do you wish you had a community to rally around you?If so, Id love to hear more about what youre cultivating (or would like to cultivate) when it comes to listening to your body and your sweet self. You can reply to this email and itll go straight to me.In devotion to our resilience,Hannah",

    "Mechanical Necessity": {
      "text": "Nothing happens in our [human] biology without mechanical inputs. - Dr Michael ChiversI spent the 4 weeks learning about the body.It was amazing.Most mornings the last month, I set aside 1-2 hrs to watch lectures, and made my way through the Postural Respiration home-study course and then the Functional Range Assessment.In both cases, I came away with much, much moreinfo, ideas, questionsthan I know how to use right now. But I understand a few things a little better. And heres oneThe literal mechanical movement of our body is critical to the health* of our body, on a biological level.*health is an often-politicized word, used to coerce behavior that has nothing to do with the actual level of function at any constituent part; in this case I health to mean exactly that: quality, low-effort maintenance of homeostasis; freedom from chronic or acute stressors, ample ability to recover from stress.As a fitness guy its probably not surprising that I would have a nose for a point like that.But its easy to get focused on the macro-picture of our livesthe large motor patterns that our bodies carry out each and every day, over and over, with varying levels of ease, effort, and grace.And this last month has really taken me on a journey into the inner, micro-world of our bodies, where cells are transferring every single movement of our bodies into information (via microtubules and the inner cellular musculoskeletal system) that in turn becomes the blueprint for our future selvesaka DNA.This means that we quite literally write ourself (in DNA molecules) into physical form, via the movement of our bodies.In turn, on the macro- level, the regular movement of our lives begin to establish non-random-but-chaotic patterns of behavior and tissue; if these patterns are not BILATERAL, hemi-bodied and hemi-diaphragmed, many of the critical functions of our nervous system (vagal nerve, dorsal root ganglions, etc) and digestive system can be disrupted.With this uneven, back-and-forth perspective on our bodies (from the brilliant PRI framework), the LEFT back and RIGHT front of the rib-cage are of critical focus of training simply to balance the natural and universal difference in shape and size of the human diaphragm.And heres that big take-away again: only thru movement can we really understand how and why some of the most common patterns begin to arise, and only thru movement (slowly integrated via isometric breath work) can your body find the way back to the graceful ease of a BI-pedal animal.But I nerd-gressTaken altogether, all this learning really has gotten me refocused on the fundamentals of what it means to have a human body, and how much can be made with the simple and yet profound tools of a nervous SYSTEM, with resplendent, redundant feedback loops a universe of cells (called fibroblasts) that automagically move toward lines of stress they sense within the cytoskeleton of soft tissue through out our bodies an inherently unbalanced system within our body (the diaphragm) thatlike a pendulumprompts us into motionif only we can listen for its needsAnd because of the nature of these tools, a reductionist, one-size-fits-all program of exercise is definitely not gonna cut it.Instead, we need to cultivate perception, and find motivation to turn a clear-eyed attention toward our physical ourselves.The specific details of what to do will come as we need them, and will differ for all of us.But the mission can be the same: restore the basic tools that our bodies have evolved, get curious about our body and its limits, and in time remember how to dream big, physical dreams.In your corner, Coach WillPS: As Im integrating all this info, Im thinking about putting together a Full ROM Breathing Course focused on optimizing respiratory function.lemme know if you want to be part of the first group, ok? Just hit reply with breathing and Ill get you more details",

    "Your Own Reward": {
      "text": "The best motivator for working out I know is simply this: showing up to your next workout is the ONLY way to realize the ways your last workout have impacted your body.Gotta show up to reap the reward.Lets be honest: the actual moment of working out is  not always comfortable . It cant beif youre trying to prompt beneficial adaptations in the various tissues and systems of your body.But dont get me wrong working out most definitely can be a joyful, pleasurable, affirming, FUN activity. It can be something you LOOK FORWARD to . Yeseven for you.That enjoyment-factor, in my experience, often comes down to finding that careful balance between challenge and effort*. But when youre close, that balance becomes fueled by Little Wins.Little Wins are everywhere, strewn around life just waiting to be noticed, but in training they look a lot likeNoticing a movement is *easier* since last time you tried itSurprise Strength Events (such as: carry a couch like a Badass, jump over a crazy fence, paint your bedroom inaday)Realizing certain chronic aches and pains in your body are now  absent (!!)Grounded moments of feeling really good, by just being in your bodyNow getting back to the best motivator I know, the reward from these Little Wins is unlocked by simply noticing them, and its a modest amount of motivating energy to be sure. Butcruciallytaken together those Little Wins quickly add up to some serious Momentum.Pretty soon you get curious about what little improvements or progress your might notice at the next workout, and the workout-experience dial has shifted significantly toward Enjoyable. Usually, you can find a few Little Wins each and every time you work out, and most days you dont, too. Thats a lot of Little Wins.In time, Big Wins are not just possible, but inevitableYou did that backpacking adventure you had always dreamt aboutYou successfully rehabbed that major knee injuryYou managed to move through a major work or life stress, and come out the other side. These are the big, important wins that we sometimes experience in life.So day by day, as you follow the path of Little Wins, youre fueling your work by setting up progress for your Future Self to enjoy. And in this process, you gradually get to know yourself better, too, simply by noticing what works and what just doesnt.Each workout becomes much more about realizing your new-found capacities, and appreciating incremental progress, than achieving BIG goals (which happen much less often), crafting a certain body-shape, or making up for any sort of not-enough-ness you might feel.Now maybe youre nodding along, and saying, Duh Will, I know this! I already *enjoy* working out.If thats you, I now want to empower you to do TWO things with your trainingEmbrace those physical outlets that really light you up. Do you LOVE to be outside hiking? Or maybe you just cant get enough kayaking, pottery-making, or jiu-jistu? Whatever it is, lean in. This will further sweeten those Little Wins (cuz you already know you like to move this way!)Use your training time to address your REAL physical weaknesses. Constant assessment and focus on the fundamentals of your physical well-being (nervous system activity, joint health, cardiovascular function, agency, social/community support) means that you will gradually move toward MORE efficiency and function, and stave off the ways our bodies inevitably come undone (entropy!). For this reason, Im a firm believer that training time is best spent on the things that make the most LONG-TERM change; and whatd be the point of enduring the requisite discomfort?These can be tough questions to ask/answer in the best of circumstances, but can be extra tough to crack at first. There is just so much conditioning around each of us needing to look a certain way, or live life in a certain healthy way, that we forget to tune into the most PURE source of body wisdom: OUR OWN BODIES.Exploring the information your body is offering youaka Trainingis exactly the kind of structure we offer folx in our Unlimited membership.We collaborate with you on how to A.) Set-up and truly appreciate those Little Wins, and B.) uncover and re-condition those parts of your health-picture that are impacting your physical freedom.Sound good? Book a call with me! Id love to help get you started on asking these questions, and grabbing those Little Wins, in your own life.In your corner,Coach Will*Too much/little challenge, OR too much/little effort, and things break (your body, your hormonal system, your spirit).",

    "But\u2014Why Mobility?": {
      "text": "I saw a great graphic this morning, posted on instagram by the awesome dancer/coach/thinker @yuenjon          Coach Will here. I love this image because it gets right to the heart of the big question  What should I do for fitness?And I love the accompanying post because Jons implied answer is so expansive (and correct IMO): do whatever you want, first and foremost.Movement is integral to humans because it literally is the embodiment of our ability to live, to go after the things we want and to be able to avoid the things that might do us harm.So when Jon (or i) say that the fact that you DO move your body is much, much more important than HOW you move your body we are basing that on the aspects of each of us humans that are the same, the parts of our experience that overlap across every person (tho of course, not every part of every person...)That is, we base it on our essential humanity.And this means that the particular way that the innate drive to MOVE shows up in each of our individual modern livesa time when survival is no longer linked to the movement of our bodyis as varied and amazing as our socks, or our cooking, or our dreams.So then why do I spend most of my time evangelizing for the practice of Mobility trainingwhich comes with the clear intention of altering HOW you move? (And why oh why does it need such a NON-sexy name?! sigh)The reason lies in this fact  all too often, movement doesnt show up in someones life at all. And when it goes missing, all of the systems in our body that require mechanicalmovementinputs for function (which is ALL of them) begin to degrade and break-down.As the parts of the system run down, movement stops feeling quite as good. Maybe eventually it actually feels bad (like when we get injured).At the heart of WHY movement stops feeling good is because one of the most crucial body components that degrades is our ability to feel ourselves....aka, the literal ability to notice sensation.When you cant feel yourself clearly, on a sensation level, your brain is blind to all the possible ways you might find to move.And with that blindness, the idea of movement gets less and less bright, exciting, pleasurable, motivating; in contrast, when the brain can see all the sensations of your body, it can find the most effective, most fun, best way to move YOUR body.So what's the antidote? How do we reverse this negative sensation doom spiral....? We give the body more information, especially at it's edges. Which means, we give the body more experience (moving/working/training) at end range.By introducing the body to it's 'boundaries' (the full range of motion of all of your joints), your brain now has a ton of useful, actionable information about what's possible to do in the world around it (aka around YOU). Over time, and given enough information, your brain will absolutely figure out your particular movement need, your WHAT; my job is to help your brain get the information it needs to do this magic.If moving and changing your body in this way sounds exciting or interesting Id love to set up a call with you. (Book one by clicking HERE) . I could seriously think and talk about this stuff all day...In your corner,Will",

Over the past few months, Ive been getting clearer and clearer signals from my body that I need some space to feel into what kind of art/coaching/offering Im really in this world to make, and Im realizing it might not have a shape that fits in with fitness. So, I must leave this container and make room for what wants to emerge.Lucky for all of us, Will is excited to take the helm and steer the TFA ship. Some of you may know this, but in our first iteration of relationship, I hired Will to be my trainer! Weve been through many evolutions since then, but I still think he is one of the best coaches around, and I trust him to take amazing care of our TFA clients.My last day coaching for TFA will be November 30th, 2021.And, this change doesnt mean that our connection must end! I welcome you to stay in touch, either via social media (@hannahhusband on Instagram) or email (hannahjhusband@gmail.com), depending on what suits your style.Second bit of news:Will is now offering in-person 1-1 sessions in Oakland.We soft-launched this about a month ago so we could test it and work out the kinks. If youve been waiting in the wings, longing to work with us, but knowing you need that IRL touch, now is your moment! Send us an email to info@thefitnessalchemists.com and we will get you on the books.Thank you for taking a few moments each week to read our writing. I truly believe that all humans deserve to have a loving relationship with their own bodies -- regardless of physical ability, size, race, gender, or any other identity that they have chosen or been saddled with. As I look back on our newsletters (which are all available on the TFA Blog, btw) it makes me proud to see how our thoughts have evolved.Thank you for being part of this conversation.With deep respect,Hannah",

    "That time of year\u2026": {
      "text": "Its that time a year again when holiday parties roll around and I get asked (usually by a stranger) the perennial question (usually several times over the course of a season)So *youre* a trainer ... how do I lose this gut?! (or some variation on this self-flagellating body-size comment).I look up from my boozy eggnog, smile, and ... have no idea what to say.First, I cant help but want to grab them, hug them, and tell them that the SIZE of their body, the girth of their gut and the shape of their WHATEVER really ... doesnt ... matter ... when it comes to their fitness (or their abilities, health, background, level of virtue, morality, or worth).** Having a belly, or thighs, or bony edges is rad, all of it--all of YOU--as are all of the other radical ways our bodies simply are, right now...because being alive is miraculous ......But thats a lot to unpack at a holiday party.Over the years I've learned (after much hand-wringing), I now know to do a side-step and ask them about what kind of movement brings them JOY.Because truly, the first and most important thing to know about a person, to help their fitness, is to know what kind of activities they WILL do, out of pure satisfaction....Walk a forest trail? Swim? Play pick-up soccer? Waltz in the kitchen with their love? (Remembe JOY means it's actually fun, pleasurable, dopamine-producing...?!)Only then, once you tune into that JOY signal, can you begin exploring how to orient your body and all its parts to be more effective at *that* (and, often, that feels like things hurt less). To become more fit *for* that (and not just look fit, which is...again...not a thing ).For me, the activities that get my heart pumping with JOY (and with blood! heart) are riding my bike around the East Bay hills, play-fighting with my nephews, and saying yes to (almost) any weird physical adventures that life throws across my path.But by no means is that the ONLY thing I do training-wise; in order to get keep my body ready to invite JOY in, I end up doing a lot of what you see happening in the time-lapse below...          ...and THIS is the stuff I wish I could show/talk-thru with my new party-friend .. cuz doing this stuff really changes how it feels to live inside your body. I might be biased  , but I can say it unequivocally: this stuff works if you do it.What you see (if you click the pic and watch the time-lapse video) is lots of @posturalrestoration breathing drills, interspersed with lots of #CARs variations and then some short-n-sweet strength exploration (basically: Wonder if I can do THAT? in tiny progressive steps).So as we all wade in to this (possibly fraught) holiday season holiday, I wish you a.) some grace and kindness for yourself and your body, and b.) an invitation to move in the ways that give you JOY, now and forever...- Coach Will**If this shocks you, go check out a #HealthAtEverySize practitioners work, and start exploring how #FatPhobia shows up in your life (its usually a part of all of our lives, if weve lived in a western country for the last few decades). Weight stigma and fatphobia cause heart-breaking harm on a daily basis, on playgrounds, work places and medical offices around the world.",

    "don\u2019t skip the breaks!": {
      "text": "Hey friend,If youre anything like me during this wintery time of year, when the days shorten and the temperature drops, there will be inevitable breaks in the schedule and hiccups in your habits. Of course!but it can feel like dog-sh*t.On some level we all know that breaks and rest are normal and important part of ANY biological system (including us humanoids), but when the actual moments of release and relaxation come, it can be oh-so-tempting to judge the ever-living snot out of yourself for giving in to that tendency.And Im writing to push back on that idea.Maybe theres a demanding boss or job pushing you to WORK MOAR. Or maybe the WORK MOAR cultural signal is just internalized, and constantly nibbling at the edges (dat me!).But wherever its coming from, its not serving the deepest and greatest version of You.Lemme back up.the more I notice this WORK MOAR tendency ingrained right into our cultural identity (at least in America), I try to see this yearly, seasonal reminder from nature as a moment to re-contextualize.As in, zoom out and notice what context all that work exists within. All too often, the work is lending us identity (Im a hard worker!) rather than helping us build the world that we want (and/or the version of ourselves that will build that world).And thats a sneaky and damning substitution.Its undeniable: the winter solstice season is full of all kinds of things that (potentially) remind us of how wonderful the world is warmth from strangers, connection with community, gratitude, generosity, ancestral wisdom, food that connects us with each other and our past, and much more. (Andtheres a lot of grief during this season, too. #real )And the real kicker is that our world offers us these gifts just  because!Just because were alive, and together, and we made it through another cycle of seasons. Miraculous!Crucially, we didnt get these gifts because we worked for them.They just are there, and its up to us to embrace and connect with them, or. not.It is in this context, that the drive to WORK MOARwithout an equally clear-headed idea of what for or why you are workingreveals itself as just another compulsive behavior.Now.maybe that compulsive behavior is doing some big work for you to help self-soothe these days, and Im not here to judge what helps you cope with your life-challenges (of which there are also many around this time of year!).But if Ive learned one thing in 2021, its that the most beautiful, and creative, and delightful things in our worldthe really GREAT ideas that each of us might have withinarise out of the moments of nothingness in our life, when there are gaps in all the bustle.Its in these moments of rest that some of the very best ideas and perspectives begin their slow, ungainly creep into the light of our awareness.So when the days tighten and the nights get long and cold, I hope that you can lay down the weight of always needing to WORK MOAR, and slice off a few, precious moments of just being.Who knows what might become clear in those gaps?Wishing you warmth and wonder this season,Coach Will",

      "text": "         New Membership StructureGreetings!Well 2022 has fully reared its head (Im trying to ignore the memes about 2020, too ), and Im happy to report that we are unveiling something weve been cooking up for almost a year: a private social network built around helping folx build their most joyful movement practice.Im calling it The Fitness Alchemists Collective, and in addition to being the much-improved new home for our epic Kinstretch class library (120 classes and growing strong!), it will also be the platform for upcoming events and workshops that Im really excited about running later this year.But maybe the part Im *most* excited about is that it will be bringing people together in their individual pursuit of a physical JOY practice. Its the real good stuff thats soooo hard to find when training alone, at home.Its that elusive combination of traveling your individual journey while in good company that is motivational and energetic cat-nip for our subconscious selves. Nothing else really drives us humans the same way.So with how isolating and yet hyper-connected the last couple years have been, Im really looking forward to exploring and growing the TFA signal (that ALL bodies have the opportunity to grow toward a richer and deeper experience of their physical world) within the safe bounds of a closed online community.Now, as someone who is tuning in to our work, I wanted to let YOU in first on how were structuring our new memberships on this platform.Access to The Fitness Alchemists Collective: offered at a modified sliding scale rate ($30, 60, 90 per month)**Optional member only add-ons: custom workout programming, discounted private sessions, early/discounted access to workshopsAll memberships are month-to-month, and compliments well with any other physical training or rehab you might currently be doingOur work is centered in people-first action and language (#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies), and were definitively anti-racist, anti-diet and anti-ableistAll of these membership changes have been toward building a degree of flexibility (one of my FAVORITE things) and accessibility into the very structure of our fitness + coaching offerings.Because life tends to shift! and people tend to need different things over time to help support them in their physical journey. And boy-o-boy I am HERE for that!The bottom line is: Im a big fan of change (even if it gives me the heebie-jeebies in the actual moment).Now, one more thing to mention, about accessibility  as in price accessibility.During my time working in the fitness industry, and on-going frustration of mine has been how costly many of the really positive and effective fitness offerings are out there.Sure, there are plenty of low-cost options available, but to get personalized, human-first fitness coaching almost always comes with a hefty price-tag. Which means it is literally not available for many, many people.So this is my best anti-capitalist-business-owner response: you tell me what you can pay! (Between those 3 tiers I mention above)And if the lowest tier of membership is too high for you, send us an email well set you up at a lower rate.Because I believe that these simple movement practices that we are centering at the Collective are too important to be cut-off from all the humans who simply cant pay. I believe that given the right tools, the person each of us can become is exactly what our current world needs.And if Im wrong? Well I guess Id rather believe .Thats all for now! and I hope to see you soon in the new Collective.Onwards,WillPS: Know anyone who might want to give the new Collective a shot?

      "text": "Heyyyy there,Today I am SO excited to be attending the second-EVER Internal Strength Method seminar being run at Cal Berkeley by the Functional Range System team of instructors.This is the same group that generated Functional Range Conditioning (FRC) and Kinstretch, and effectively flipped my personal-trainer-brain upside down when I took my first course in 2017.An emoji doesnt quite cover it but wtf  FRS makes me  in the best way.I was trying to articulate recently to a new chiropractor friend what it is about this approachFunctional Range Systems (FRS)that is so compelling for me, and why it peaks my curiosity so strongly even after years of working and learning FRS.Beyond just the breadth and depth of their grounding in actual, published research (which is prodigious), this team of thinkers is committed to understanding the challenges of movement as clearly as they can.This is such a different, and refreshing, focus compared to so many educators in the fitness/movement space (believe me, Ive taken a LOT of certifications, and the quality ranges WIDELY ).Because rather than impatiently jumping straight to solutions to the problems facing humans as they move, these FRS folx stay intent on comprehending reality in the body as clearly as they can, from a macro AND micro perspective.They consciously work to see the forest for the trees, but also the trees, and make decisions about their work with people using this information (This is sometimes referred to as System 2 thinking, as coined by Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky).This is in contrast with much of the dominant approach to training and teaching movement, which is consumed with simplifying the human body into manageablebut incompletecomponents. It effectively prioritizes ease of decision-making over perception of reality (aka System 1 thinking).Now, working with humans and bodies this second way (System 1) might seem easier, but not when you consider the long-term effects of obscuring reality in favor of palatability. That future is a disorienting and frustrating place (full of But I thought?!)The FRS approach instead is not fragile in the face of nuance, or complexity, and allows that shrewder lens to inform the action steps that they take with their movers/clients/patients, etc.In turn, this indicates a certain optimism, and belief, in the work of people (like me!) who learn the FRS system, and subsequently the people who I (and other learners) work with.As in, FRS puts powerin the form of knowledge about realityinto the very hands of people teaching and moving. They empower us to know ourselves better.This is basically the opposite of the tired expert-worship that pervades fitness, for movers and coaches alike, and it feels so expansive. And this idea absolutely fires me up, whether Im working with a brand-new elderly client or one of my rough-and-tumble 20-something yahoo clients.Because in either case, Im helping that person know themselves better, directly, and the potential of that upgrade is limitless In strength,Coach Will",

    "How Fatphobia Distorts the World": {
      "text": "I'm feeling fiery today, and it's because I know that there are people out in the world (maybe you?) who are feeling blocked in their ability to enjoymovementbecause of that scabby scourge that isfatphobia.And that's counter to my mission, of bringing people back totheirmovement joy practice ('cuz we all had one when we were 4, ya know??).Now, the more I learn about bodiesand you KNOW how much I like to learn the more clearly I see all the ways that fatphobia (and its colleagues inbullsh*tcalled able-ism, health-ism, race-ism and all the other -isms) make the work of training (akaguiding your body to feel better and do more) much, much harder.Again and again, fatphobia stands in the way of our individual AND collective progress.On the one hand, fatphobia contributes to the daily subjugation of people who have visible body-fat on their bodies.As Lindy West first (in my world) pointed out, anti-fat bias is one of the last socially acceptable ways to discriminate against people publicly and directly to their face (not to mention behind their back, too).And yet health practitioners, from massage therapists and personal trainers to doctors and psychiatrists,routinelyfocus on a persons weight (or worse, their BMI, a useless sham of a statistic) to bully them into behavior change. (When has bullying ever worked? As in long-term, measurable change that DIDNT come with terrible side-effects?)This kind of systematic bias causes pain and suffering, inside and out; in my opinion, itis a form of violence.This, of course, props up thesocial/cultural pressures that point toonebody shape as the right one, and cast the others aside.And this message leaks intoallof our psyches, whether we look fat or not. Raise your hand if you have felt fat no matter how you look, or what other people say about your body?>>raises hand<<In fact, I spent a solid portion of my teens and twenties obsessing about my food intake, over-exercising, and rapidly fluctuating my weight. I didnt look like I had an eating disorder (which is not something you *can* see, anyway), but if it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.Thankfully,I got the message, and started moving away from this harmful way of seeing and treating my body.And I am happy to see that the wordisstarting to get out into the broadermeme-o-sphere, as well, and the 'word' is this:fatphobia isnt based on scientific reality.Body fat is not a signifier of health, let alonemorality, and any guidance that puts the LOSS of body fat as a goal above all the other ways that someone might make their body and world a better, safer, place to be, is downright negligent.Humans come in different sizes.Period.Only when a critical mass of people in the world see that fact asfactcan we let (all) humans be humansmagnificent, imperfect, creative, communal, energetic, sluggish, allll of itand get down to the real business of saving ourselves, each other, and our world.And if you're curious to learn a bit more, I can *highly* recommend subscribing to Virgie Tovar'sBody Positive Universityas a friendly (and fiendishly smart) guide into this way of seeing ourselves and the culture we all swim in. I look forward to reading her emails evvvverytime.That's all for now!In your corner,Will",

    "What's the 'right' approach to fitness?": {
      "text": "Hey,I have been working hard recently on more clearly definingwhoandwhat The Fitness Alchemists as a company,is for.Whydoes this company exist?! (nothing like a little existentialism to kick off your Saturday sip and scroll, or whenever you're reading this...)Now I'm already cooking up a separateblog-post article about the name--where it came from and why I've stuck with it. But today I wanted to share something different: who I amnottrying to work with. Who Idon'tthink I'm the 'right fit' for.And I'm curious to hear what you think.So my thoughts about this came togetheras an answer to a question fromSeth Goden, as part of The Marketing Seminar(super interesting online course I'm taking)...Q:Why might your ideal client find you, understand your promise, and still decide it isnt for them?And here's my answer...Because they want to thinklessabout, and feellessfrom, their bodies during their movement time (workout, exercise, lifting, cardio). In contrast, I definitely ask people to think, to feel, to embody, while moving, and that is not for everyone, and its not for everytimein a persons life.The benefits of what Im offering (my training/coaching) have some really incredible long-term payoffs (more resilient, mobile joints that are less injury-prone), andwillmake you a more effective mover, no matter your sport/activity/movement-interest.SoulCycle, on the other hand, offers a spiritual experience, with dubious long-term benefits, this afternoon, for $40.We both are calledfitness, but we essentially trade in different things entirely.And thats OK! In fact, the way we're different means we might actually be a good compliment. It means the world takes all types, andmovement can be, and IS, many things for many people. Im just focused on my little corner, where we work on making joints move and feelbetter.In the same vein, my approach demands your attention, your time, for at least 10min a day. This isnt much time, but it is something, and it speaks to a bigger way that Imight not be for you.I wont be pushing you thru the workout per se (tho I do offer an on-demand class library), so this has to be something YOU want. Will my guidance and accountability help? Sure thing, but I need to make sure you are building your movementagencyfrom the beginning of us working together.Because I believe that if thru us working together, you becomemore dependent on external guidance, and LESS trusting of your own body signals, then I have failed at my job.After all,youare doing the moving,youare feeling the important info aboutyourbody. Im just here to help you orient, and direct your exploration into the incredible possibilities of your human body.And of course, that means youget the biggestpay-off, too: a stronger, more comfortable body, that is ready foryouradventure, whatever that might be.But! this approach is not for everyone. Some people just want a quick movement fix, like a cup of coffee, and thats what their lives have space for, and I aint judging a one of them.Cuz at the end of the day... motion is lotion, whatever it looks like.Wishing you well!- Coach Will",

    "So\u2026 why \u2018Alchemy\u2019?": {
      "text": "I always get a chuckle when I remember that the name of my business includes the word Alchemy.It conjures up images for me of Merlin the wizard, and dusty explosions coming out of medieval workshops and the like.We originally chose it/found it thru the process of prime coffeeshop brain-jamming I was doing with my (then) business partner as we got started back in 2016.But now days, I realize more and more often that alchemy is so commonly used as a science-sounding filler-noun in the parts of the market/culture that some might identify as woo woo (I hope Im saying that right ).And while I see the reasoning and importance of woo in our world (Ill get to that more ), I also very clearly see and care about the parts of reality that woo misses. Namely, that there are observable, scientific certainties; not everything is up for grabs and interpretation in the physical world.Even if our amazing human brains can think new things upNow dont get me wrong any scientist worth their salt will tell you that there is far more of the universe that we dont know about or understand than that we do. Like it aint even close (some estimates put our actual understanding of just the extent of the known physical universe to be like 1%).*But then again, even in cases where we dont know WHY something happens exactly (like gravity), we can count on that thing HAPPENING (like with gravity).No matter your particular world view, Id bet that youd agree: theres a gap between observable, scientific realities (aka the evidence, or research, or scientific studies) and our actual understanding about WHY things are happening.Extended into the human body, these gaps really come into focus, maybe because we have to also contend with our own subjective sense of ourselves.We can observe certain changes over time, but at the same time know that by measuring and observing one thing (or a few things) we are neccessarily not seeing the whole organism (aka the PERSON). We cant it all in if we are focused on a few pieces.So us trainersaka those (crazy?) people who believe that by moving yourself in certain, specific ways, you can actually change your physical reality by getting more coordinated, growing new tissue and expanding your endurance/capacityare choosing to face a funny challenge that is equal parts science and magic.Or, Alchemy. And the weirdest part? thats the best that any of us trainers (or PTs, Chiros, massages therapists, mental health therapists, etc etc etc) we can doany of usto help you: we can help guide you (an unknowable WHOLE) based on the specific details we DO know about the world generally (aka the evidence, grounding, andhopefullyscience). And, we can (try to) learn.Im curious  what does the word alchemy bring up for you? Other than, ya know, The Fitness Alchemists .In your corner,Coach Will* This is where the woo factor comes in for me, and seems really useful and even important: we all need to contend with the fact that there are parts of the universe, our experience, everything really, that we do not and will not ever understand. I think this capacity to NOT know things, and be ok with it, is sometimes called the ability to tolerate ambiguity, or wisdom. And the wide world of woo happens to offer a cornucopia of pathways to engaging with this deeply ancestral knowledge (somethings that is also sometimes referred to as wisdom).** Image accessed at https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/the-language-of-alchemy",

      "text": "Every single person I have ever worked with has faced an identical challenge in training their bodies: knowing what maximum effort actually feels like.Its a simple enough concept to describecontract your muscle as much as you possibly canbut the challenge comes when you actually try to, uhhh, do it.And that challenge is always a unique experience. Of course it is, right? Because you cant feel what you cant feel.yet.With steady practice, a few times a week, you really can become more adept at the skill of strength. You really can make yourself stronger through regular, intensity-seeking inputs to your tissues.Because this ability is a changeable capacity; in fact, its the main thing that changes as people train and build muscle, improve skill and get stronger. Its you teaching your brain how to control your body, literally. In fact, changing your nervous systems maximum voluntary contraction ability is at the very heart of Strength & Conditioning as a field.Basically, when you exert as much force as you can voluntarily, over and over, you progressively get better at getting your muscle to contract fully.Your nervous system becomes MORE able to engage your body tissues, and you steadily get stronger and stronger as a result.Its magic! (but not reallyits actually a phenomenon that is consistently and dependably observed in real humans #science  which is maybe even cooler than magic?)*Now even given this powerful training tool, working up the energy to do these kind of high-intensity efforts during your week, and having the necessary time for rest and recovery around those efforts, is no joke.Even the most committed, consistent folx that I train will inevitably have off weeks (or months) where they need to lay off these high intensities to be able to recover to a baseline of feeling well.While much of our culture would say otherwise, it is not actually possible to just keep doing more. At some point, we all break.But this is exactly why I think prioritizing some of your movement life to developing this ability is a crucial, and usually enjoyable, aspect of building your own truly healthy bodyyour health being something that is as unique to you as your fingerprint.By regularly touching your ceiling, the very top of your ability to contractto go 100% in a safe mannermeans that your regular life demands steadily feel easier and easier. Your system is prompted to get a different kind of a rest, but then also comes back stronger.Said simply, adding hi-intensity to your life in the right way can be exactly the eustress (dfn: positive, or adaptive, stress) that your system needs in order to grow.Curious about how you might start adding this kind of training into your life?

For us, the idea of turning ordinary and abundantly available metals into rare and precious gold is a perfect metaphor for the transformative process that fitness can be.Let's start with the Ordinary. In our coaching practice, the ordinary metals are the tools we use to create the transformation: movement & nutrition.They aren't fancy. They are time tested.Strength training has been around for hundred of years.the human body needs to push, pull, squat and hingeKettle bells are literally a lump of dark metalbasic nutrition goes a long way! And there are universal principles that just about every diet can agree on. Coach Will outlines this in more detail here.The process is simple--but not easy--which is why it looks like magic to the outside observer.Most of us start a fitness journey, the kind that goes deep and stays for a long time, by thinking, \"Why do all those lucky jerks look like they're enjoying themselves?\" We feel like exercise is hard, and results are far away.The media consistently bombards us with two contradictory realities:Media Myth #1: Exercise has to be HARDWe are regularly told that extraordinary results are only achievable through extraordinary effort. No pain no gain ; \"Sweat is your fat crying\" ; you know the kind.Media Myth #2: It's easy! Just buy this thingWe are also inundated with pop-up ads and blog posts claiming that we can have it all with this one weird trick. Just take this supplement!Just buy this new machine! Just replace your breakfast with a shake!We've all seen those ads.The truth lies somewhere in between. You dont have to kill yourself, nor is there an easy, one-size fits all solution. The practices that lead to optimal health (and hotness) are simple: Move your body. Eat well. Be present. The hard part is making these practices a part of your daily life.That is where the real alchemy comes in. Taking ordinary principles, and applying them consistently over time.We believe that your body is a miraculous, self-healing machine, which requires a little regular maintenance. Our aim as coaches is to help you learn how to perform that maintenance, and integrate it into your life so that you can do it a) consistently and b) with enjoyment. That's right, you might be the \"lucky jerk\" someone else looks up to.",

    "Conscious Competence: Understanding the Stages of Acquiring a New Skill": {
      "text": "One of the factors we take into account with each new client is their learning style.Are they a visual learner - Can they replicate a movement after watching it?Do they process verbal instruction - can they hear a cue and change their movement?Do they respond well to tactile cues - are they comfortable being touched, and does it help them understand the movement?We also find that it is essential for the coach to understand where the client is on their learning trajectory. Studies have shown that there are four stages to learning a new skill. Understanding which stage each of our clients is at, helps us adjust our teaching style to suit that client's needs.\"Initially described as \"Four Stages for Learning Any New Skill\", the theory was developed at Gordon Training Internationalby its employee Noel Burch in the 1970s. The stages are described as follows:Unconscious incompetenceThe individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage.[2]The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn.[3]Conscious incompetenceThough the individual does not understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage.[4]Conscious competenceThe individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill.[3]Unconscious competenceThe individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become \"second nature\" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.\"",

      "text": "When working with our clients, we noticed that how/if someone cooks tells us a lot about how they engage generally with food, eating, and habits. Digging into their \"cooking life\" can get right to the heart of underlying issues that might be keeping someone from capitalizing on their physical, body or movement, goals, even if they are staying on top of their workouts like a champ.When it comes to cooking, we find that people fall into 3 camps: foodies who love to cook and eat great food (and fancy themselves the next top chef), agnostics who know how to make the basics but don't feel that inspired or are too busy (or, \"too busy\" :), and people who simply don't cook. Which one most accurately describes you?As I tell each of them, I'd tell you that any of those starting places is just fine--and each can have their own pitfalls, too. The foodies might already be comfortable in the kitchen, but often they need a little re-calibration about how much and how often to indulge in those finer things, and when the more basic food options will be the better ones. The agnostics usually need a little guidance and encouragement to engage with their food on a deeper level, and reap the benefits of being \"someone who cooks\". And those people who seem allergic to the kitchen might just need a positive experience of cooking simple and delicious food to see how deeply it can improve their quality of life.The reality is, while you don't need to love to cook, the lessons learned by diving in to the kitchen are invaluable. From more easily regulating how much and what types of food you're consistently eating, to becoming a better observer of how different food effects your body (\"Oh man, that In-N-Out Burger Double-Double really did a number on my chakras!\"), turning an interested eye on the day-to-day aspect of eating can be the most straight-forward way to improving your diet toward whatever goal you might have. Many clients have also reported feeling much more tied-in to their geography, community, and ethics; becoming a discerning eater matters for the planet and everyone on it.At the end of the day, what food you put in your body will be thedefining factory to achieving anything physical,really. And while there are many paths to excellence, they all involve staying engaged--with your body, your process, your goals:cooking forces you to confront those realities, like nothing else.As always, we love supporting folks on your fitness and nutrition journey.

    "How Injuries Make You Wiser": {
      "text": "It was Testing Week around here last week, our first using our new programming tools, and it successfully accomplished our main goals for such a week (hint: it wasn't ONLY for the bragging rights :). Along with several PBs (Personal Bests), this kind of highest-intensity exposure yielded some huge insights, for members and coaches alike, ranging from what the \"right\" weight feels like, to how regularly pseudo-peaking helps contextualize the normal swings of real-life (both topics for other blog posts...). But maybe the most useful lesson learned had nothing to do with achieving new bests; nope, instead, these moments of reckoning--of assessing and testing--forced the all-important confrontation with our own limitations, and all the ghoulish things you find there: injury*, frustration, weakness, and self-doubt.In every physical realm, and I do mean EVERY single one, there is that always-present opponent, often dwelling near the edges but sometimes, dramatically, totally apparent. It's shadowy, abstract, unknown and lurking, until it is suddenly extremely real. It can alter careers, change life-trajectories and dictate how every hour of a person's life is spent. It is called injury.Injuries are a problem! They are painful,they limit performance (both, in the actual moment and by restricting training leading up to an event), and, perhaps most consequentially, they are emotionally sapping. However, if they can be seen as information (more accurately described as \"desperate cries for help from the abused tissues\") we can take the first step towards understanding, relieving, and ultimately, revitalizing those tissues as part of a more resilient whole.Taken objectively, injuries are actually pretty straight-forward. They occur when the load on any given tissue is greater than that tissue's load-bearing capacity. That's it. Exposed to that load, a tissue might spasm, strain, or break, depending on a million factors (what kind of tissue? what condition was the tissue? what about the load? any co-morbidities confusing things? etc). It is the job of medical professionals to determine these types of things.Now--to be extremely clear--we are not doctors and we don't play them on TV*. And for those very reasons, we have centered our business around helping people with the critical (and oft-neglected)steps back to function, after all the diagnosis-treatment-therapy that should happen following a true injury.This return-to-function stage takes some time, and involves systematic exposure to low- and high-level stresses that address both joint-control/resiliency and holisitic adaptations, respectively. It is, basically, what our training encompasses.Testing Week is simply the peak of those \"high-level stresses\", and as outlier experiences, they can give a certain tangibility to our personal \"edges\".Us coaches love these moments of clarity because of how real it makes the training: months of abstraction (...Google spreadsheet after google spreadsheet...) magically transform into cold, hard metal weights, moving majestically in the hands of our ever-more-skilled cohort of resilient humans... (cue lights).Now, It is our job as their coach to set them up for success--to define, encourage, and frame growth experiences, and generally guide them toward getting better. Even so, working at the upper-reaches of current-ability necessarily means that sometimes, a client won't be able to achieve what they have previously, or what they expect from themselves. For these clients,the experience of attempting a personal best lift or set andfalling short can be devastating, especially if they feel limited by a previous injury that has not fully recovered, or are worried about a future injury. They very easily shift into an adversarial relationship with their body (\"Why would you fail me now, elbow/knee/back, etc!\"); not exactly cohesive for growth...Alternately, this kind of \"failure\" experience can be incredibly enlightening if--and this is a critical \"IF\"--the client can see the resulting information as the useful communication that it is: At THIS moment in time, THIS particular movement was beyond the maximum load-bearing capacity for the involved tissues. That's just as useful (and maybe more) than the personal best (because you always may have been able to do more...right?).Moving forward, this information should help make training even more specific and effective. While this kind of approach can't ever guarantee that injuries won't happen*, by involving these types of stresses in regular training, we can begin to see the greater context of our physical bodies--injuries, Personal Bests and everything in-between.The key is to use the information toward more wisdom, and not just more self-flagellation. Injuries are many things, but they are not judgments of our character; that has much more to do with how you face and address what you find as you really go looking for your edges.Stay strong!*On the topic of physical injury, we should say: we are not medical professionals, and we do not purport to offer diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or therapy for any injury or condition, and any info offered here is utterly based on our own experience and understanding of related research.",

    "The Map": {
      "text": "I used to think the brain controlled the body.Like the brain was up there in the cranium being a genius, pulling levers and pushing buttons to operate the otherwise unintelligent meat suit.I was so wrong.According the the latest research, the brain is more of a data collection & decision-making center for the body.But here's the catch: It can only make decisions based on the quality of incoming information from the rest of the body. So basically, your brain is only as \"smart\" as your body.Breath that in for a second.You can think of it like this: the brain has a \"working map\" of the body that is filled in by that incoming information.Incoming information is supplied through movementand sensory perception.The less we move, the less information we have, the blurrier and less detailed that map becomes.To make matters worse, when there is painin any part the body, that part of the map gets smudged to the point of being unreadable.Fret not, my friends. You are in control of your cartography: the MORE you move, in a pain-free range, the BETTER your map becomes.(This is the cornerstone of what I teach my clients:how to maintain and improve that map through mindful movement, such that you can get out of pain, and get better at any physical skill that matters to you.)Your map is a living map.It's not like you can move your body onceand etch the map in stone.No, it's more like we are drawing the map in wet sand, and every night the tide comes in and washes it away.This is one of the reasons it's so valuable to move every part of your body through it's fullest expression of movementevery single day.It's how we carve the map. Detail it. Make it more rich.I teach my clients to do this using Controlled Articular Rotations (or CARs for short), because rotational movement takes each joint through all of its possible movement patterns.By exploring all possible patterns every day, we draw the most richly detailed living map of our own body. This allows the brain to make the best possible decisions and employ optimal movement strategies when tackling a physical task (like putting your overstuffed carry-on suitcase in the overhead bin while 18 people are breathing down your neck waiting to get to their seats.)You don't have to do this map-drawing with CARs, but they are a really efficient way to make sure you're drawing the best map you possibly can.If you'd like to give your brain a better map to work with, you can start your own daily CARs practice with this handy follow-along-videowe made.

    "Functional Range Conditioning is Gaining Popularity": {
      "text": "We are--as a new client aptly described recently--movement and fitness *nerds*.We don't just accept the intricacies inherent to working with living, breathing humans, but actually relish them.That drive to embrace complexity is what makes us such big fans of #functionalrangesystems and the FRS fam.Rather than reducing the obstacles that folx face when they move to an easy-to-grasp set of mainstream \"rules\" (\"Everyone should squat!\", \"Cardio is evil\" \"Stretching makes you slow\" :eye roll:), the FRS system is inclusive to all of the ways that humans might want to move, and therefore inclusive to limitations that might be present as well.This is in stark contrast to the pervasive able-ism that is at the heart of much of mainstream fitness culture: \"everyone\" is invited, but you're only really part of the tribe if you can *do* certain movements, in a certain way, with a certain degree of competency.That part of our industry makes us deeply sad and frustrated, specifically because of the way it treats folx on the margins, who may struggle to move in those normative ways.Which is again why we are such supporters of an approach (FRS) that invites people, with all of their magnificent uniqueness, in on the good stuff regardless of their background, ability, interests, etc.So on the one hand, we are SO stoked to see the new \"diversity initiative\" that FRS is collaborating on with Mens Health and other partners; more FRS in the public eye is mo' betta' in our eyes.But at the same time, it brings to the fore-front a point that has been simmering for us for a while:Like any tool, FRS can be co-opted for the same tired, exclusionary ends that the fitness industry has been obsessed with since the beginning (e.g. late 19th century).Remember how our society is obsessed with glorifying thinness? And ascribes moral virtue to thin people? And how that belief system causes bodily and emotional damage to people's health, every day?Well, what concerns us is what might happen when an open system like FRS gets grouped in with *very* mainstream attitudes about fitness.Like the way that Men's Health is hyper-focused on pumping out images of hyper-masculinity. Or the way that trainers learning about \"the importance of nutrition in fitness\" is actually code for \"make sure trainers include diet advice to help their clients lose weight.\"So while the intention of this initiative--to work against structural obstacles within the fitness industry--is admirable, only time and action will tell if that intention gets realized.Have a different view? Leave a comment and let's discuss...In gratitude,Will & Hannah",
