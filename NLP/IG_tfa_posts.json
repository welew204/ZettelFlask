But ask any of our clients, when you get these suckers dialed in, 10 secs is all you need. \nSet up is key! Follow these steps: -\n#\nstart on your forearms and knees, with elbows under armpits -sink your chest towards the floor and allow your shoulder blades to slide towards your spine, then do the opposite! Press your forearms into the floor and drive your shoulder blades wide, so your shoulders feel engaged and active. \n#\nbrace your abs \n#\nstep the feet back one at a time, \nmaking a mini down dog \n#\nkeeping abs braced, squeeze your quads (to pull up on your knee caps), and then squeeze your glutes to bring the hips down towards the floor, into alignment with your shoulders \n#\ndig your elbows into the floor in order to pull your elbows towards your toes, while pulling your toes towards your elbows \n#\nhold 10 sec. breathe. .\n.\nYour goal is total body tension! This should be the hardest 10 secs of your day. We recommend doing a set of three 10sec holds, with 5-10 secs rest in between\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#thefitnessalchemists #musclesandmindfulness #fitnessisforeveryone #thefitnessalchemists #plank #rkcplank #coreworkouts #functionaltraining #efficiency @hannahhusband thanks for the videography @msypa"

Thanks to this knowledge- I have learned to control the ROM I've had for years but had no ability to use, and then continue to improve ROM  as well. Some of my best yoga poses were accomplished thanks to applying FRC principles to my warm ups getting ready for photos. Take this photo for example- Something like this- an extreme ROM- I don't \"do yoga\" to get ready for this stuff. I pull out the big guns and aggressively work on my ROM via the principles taught at FRC to open up range that was not accessible before. \u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00bb\"\n.\n.\n.\n#controlyourself #frc #funtionalanatomy #fitnessisforeveryone #fitness #fitfam #thefitnessalchemists"

From the actual practice (slow or no movt) to the time-scale that practice takes to make an effect on your body, this is not fast work. That also means it's not going to happen on it's own! So settle, be patient, and focus on what it feels like.\n//\n2. For any exercise/fitness to WORK-- especially #FRC --, it needs to be a.) Specific Enough and b.) Hard Enough. What's enough? Your body will tell you, if you're paying attention \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081. Above I'm using a plastic doo-hicky (dm for details, they're ~$12) that happens to splay my feet out in just the right way so that I feel a HI-QUALITY leg-ankle-foot stretch (specific!). From there, my P/RAILS contractions (strong isometric holds--hard!) can send just the right signal for my tissues to change in the way I want them to (more dorsiflexion!).\n//\n3. You can't figure this stuff out in a vacuum. From the incredible weekend seminars from @drandreospina @deweynielsen @hunterfitness et al (\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5\u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5) to the awesome Instagram ecosystem that has fully committed to SHARING this info,  I have been struck by the abundance-mindset of the whole #frc community...I guess there's a certain optimism that comes from doing mobility work that is truly effective \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008f. Case in point! I learned about the doo-hicky above and the potential usages from @getchimpy and his awesome IG feed\u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008c. //\nIn the#Oakland #sanfrancisco #bayarea and interested in learning more about all of this #mobilitymagic ?!

And when you do, your ability to overcome them will come down to how well you can weather that particular storm. How well you can persevere and stay focused on YOUR guiding principles.  How resilient you are.\n-\nHow do you cultivate resilience? Well, you can start with your own, physical body, the vehicle that will carry you through your personal adventure. You can work on controlling that body, making it more resistant to injury, and stronger at the tasks that YOU need, for YOUR life.\n-\nWe've found that this process--of progressively guiding the body to adapt toward a more effective version of YOU--is a perfect analogy for building resilience generally. Control what you can, acknowledge your own weakness, and focus on what's important, for YOU. Work on it.\n-\nHere's to your resilience.\n@welew_"

Here are a few of my go-to's:\n\u00e2\u009d\u0093What is my range of motion at my __(insert joint)___?\n\u00e2\u009d\u0093What does ___(insert position)___ feel like?\n\u00e2\u0081\u0089\u00ef\u00b8\u008fHow effectively can I create tension and torque at ___(insert joint/position/movement)___?\n//\n\\\\\n//\nDue to the huge (potential) range-of-motion available at the shoulder joint, \"use it or lose it\" is never more true than when we're talking about shoulder mobility.  By utilizing an FRC approach--systematically making each joint/position more functional--you find that a little bit of focused effort at YOUR crappy positions goes a long way when you then go use the shoulder in other\u00e2\u0080\u0094any other\u00e2\u0080\u0094contexts. You just need the patience to ask the questions.\n//\n\\\\\n//\nHere I'm chipping away at Shoulder (GH) External Rotation. That's one of the shapes your shoulder NEEDs in order to pullup, press, handstand, not-feel-like-garbage, etc. //\n\\\\\n//\nFirst, I'm showing Isometric contractions (PAILs/RAILs) to help solidify position (sped up 6x), then playing with KB Bent Press/Windmill/OH Squat to train into that range (not the first time I'm doing these--don't just do stuff you see on the internet unless you're clear about having the pre-requisites \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008f) and finally an unweighted version to focus on the regressive (short-angle) side of the joint (last clip is sped up to 4x). //\n\\\\\n//\nOr just shoulder day, bro \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0089\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3"

I ended up bitting off more than I could chew (upping my mileage too fast), and  hurt myself. Looking around for options, I started reading about these crazy people running in bare feet. More than the culture shock of \u00e2\u0080\u009clook ma! No shoes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, I was mighty curious as to how their feet didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just...explode. I mean\u00e2\u0080\u0094here I was, 19 years old, hobbled, unable to walk\u00e2\u0080\u0094let alone run\u00e2\u0080\u0094in $100 shoes. And they were grinning and trail running, in the snow, in their bare feet. I had to figure what these folks were doing different.\n-\u00e2\u0080\u00a2-\nNow, almost a decade later, reading and running and rotating (#cars), I have a clearer picture. But it mostly boils down to this: expose yourself to the forces that you want to master. Let them stress you, push you, mold you. Do it slowly, and with eyes wide open. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hide from those forces.\n-\u00e2\u0080\u00a2-\n#controlyourself #exposeyourself #exposeyourpractice @thefootcollective @thefitnessalchemists @functionalrangeconditioning #cars @kinstretch"

This Kinetic Stretch setup is one of my favorite ways to get ankles to work better (meaning stronger, more range of motion, and generally, contributing a positive attitude to the rest of your body \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0081). But I could just as well use it to clean up my hips, or my neck, or my _____ (insert cranky joint here). Or as @drandreospina says, it just helps me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake shit work nice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n-\u00e2\u0080\u00a2-\nLet me know if you need help with your mobility! We are now offering remote mobility coaching (follow @thefitnessalchemists for more info in coming weeks) but the first wave of clients have been loving it. Also setting up @truecoach.co has been a blast, and is such a satisfying way to deliver this kind of super-individualized training. #controlyourself #mobility #findyourgold #fitness #butbetter"

The world is an incredible place. Enjoy... #Repost @intrinzen with @get_repost\n\u00e3\u0083\u00bb\u00e3\u0083\u00bb\u00e3\u0083\u00bb\nThe Mat Effect: the mat can \u00e2\u0080\u009copen a neurological window\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which for at least a few minutes, new movement patterns can emerge. The mat does not \u00e2\u0080\u009cteach\u00e2\u0080\u009d the horse to do bigger and/or more fluid movements, it opens the possibility. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to us to *use* this effect by spending a few minutes in each mat session empowering *movement exploration*.\n.\nOnce the horse is comfortable with the mat, we spend only a minute or less on it *before moving off!* We use a concept from Dr. Craig Liebenson that he refers to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire, wire, seal\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire\u00e2\u0080\u009d stage *opens* the window. This can be from a massage, kinesiology tape, any manual therapy OR from certain activities designed to produce an immediate (temporary) change in the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s range of motion, coordination, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfiring\u00e2\u0080\u009d and activation patterns, etc. But unless we now *WIRE* this new/temporary capability into movement solutions, it will be nothing more than temporary. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just want the body to *experience* the new pattern/possibility... we want the body to (eventually) *OWN* it. So we do a few carrot stretches or other core stability challenge on the mat to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire\u00e2\u0080\u009d something, then we immediately move off for a minute.

That collection of the highest highs and shittiest lows make each of us *exactly* who we are--and definitively different from one another.\n\nWhen people *know* what their particular body needs, then you just need to ... do repetitions. Learn. Improve, strengthen, resilient-ify yourself.\n\nHere is a snapshot of a student who has been putting in the work (check out that 3rd number--86% workout consistency over the past 90 days), and has an absolutely upgraded hip to show for it.\n\nWhen we are each as different as we are, the tools to progress (less pain, more function), must also be tailored, made-to-fit. But once they are--watch out!\n\nDM us to find out what *your* mobility program looks like \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008a"

An honest answer from Coach @welew_ :\n\nOne of the early indicators that Kinstretch was the modality for me was how freely it allowed me to play with the concepts.\n\nUnlike other approaches, with strict requirements and rigid guidelines, Kinstretch simply lays out a few procedures that dance near and around the end-ranges of our motion.\n\nHere, I am exploring my end ranges of hip abduction (aka: how much I can spread my knees apart), and then hip flexion (aka how close I can bring my thighs toward my belly). I'm using the floor, moving slow, and bracing with lots of internal contraction so that I can *accurately* determine if I'm close to my end ranges.\n\nI am *not* copying a shape I saw someone *else* make. I am not \"targeting a muscle/group\". I'm simply exploring, with control.\n\nThe result: improved fluency and heightened capacity at the joints I'm using.\n\naka a better understanding of my self.\n_\n\nOur #kinstretch classes are offered daily, each one serving up a delicious scoop of get-to-know-yourself goodness.\n\nDM is with questions or sign up to try a class using the link in our bio.\n\n#toyourresilience\n#allbodieswelcome\n#knowyourself\n#doANYthing"

Finally, having quality tools matters.\n\nA carpenter cannot do their work without tools (the sharper the better), nor can a saxophonist, a chef, or a chemist. \nThe right tools extend the expert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intellect, curiousity, experience and aspirations into their chosen medium. \nWhen the medium is our moving body, the \"tools\" are our joints.\n\nInstead of sharpening the edge of our blades, we must practice controlling our movement at the edges of our joints (aka, our end ranges). The fundamental right of all human beings to learn about themselves by controlling themselves simplifies our job as your coaches to a simple aim: teach our students to be able to move--with control and without pain--all the joints in their bodies with as many degrees of freedom as possible.\n\nWhen we set the bar this high, every other goal flows organically, and simply comes down to resources: as in, how much time and energy *you* have to practice the patterns, skills or attributes you want, given the joints that you actually have.

Clearly *feel* the shoulder as a sealed, liquid-filled space (capsule) between a few bones that all intersect in the corner of our body (DO CARs daily!) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in this video I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m feeling what my scapula (and then elbow) can do from an \u00e2\u0080\u009cedge\u00e2\u0080\u009d position at my shoulder (GH) capsule. The neighboring joints have a lot to share.\n.\n2. Engage *real* strength to reach into the edges of this capsule (TRAIN your sh*tty parts!) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 here I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m focusing on a Passive Range Lift-Off: how high can I lift my wrist off my back while ONLY (trying to \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00a4) use my shoulder (GH) joint? <\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a question that just looks like an exercise .\n3. Link up this snapshot of joint-position (the isometric training from step 2) with your general understanding of \u00e2\u0080\u009cshoulder\u00e2\u0080\u009d (what it can do, how it can move, but mostly just how it *feels* when you attempt to control it) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Do more CARs, with actual goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099-for-it effort!\n.\nSo many people short-change the work that their body is so clearly asking for. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be that person! Start exploring. This sequence was the result of my own tinkering on my own body. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an exercise to copy so much as a series of questions to engage with.\n.\nAs always, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t guess about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing or what you need\u00e2\u0080\u0094you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to.

This pressure can be an immense source of stress.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nBoth of these are examples of how Diet Culture maintains it's grip on our society.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nDiet Culture perpetuates the false narrative that health and body size/appearance are correlated--**THEY ARE NOT** -- and in doing so, entices each of us to spend ever more of our lives on the project of changing our body size in the name of \"health\" #lifethief\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWhich is why when I hear or see coaches advocating for us to all \"de-stress\" and \"get real about the dangers of chronic stress\", I wonder if they consider the stress built into our culture that drives us all to see thinner as better and fatter as less-than.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWhile some do (looking at all you wonderful #HAES teachers and trainers ), many do not. And when they don't, they are effectively propping up a world-view that adds toxic stress to the lives of millions, in the name of \"health\". After all, weight stigma is a real thing, and causes serious harm.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nIf this feels like a new idea for you, I'd encourage you to start following these hashtags: #WeightStigma #HAES (Health At Every Size) as well as these great thinkers @thethicknutritionist @yrfatfriend @chr1styharrison @ragenchastain\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n- Coach @welew_\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodieswelcome\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#findyourgold\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#bodyliberation\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#befriendyourbody"

And find out where YOU need to start your One Arm Pushup journey.\n\nIf you want to join us for more training like this, that is wholly focused on getting the right inputs for YOUR body, join us on our Facebook page for free FB Live workouts, M/W/F @ 12p PST.

If you have an old injury that has limited what you do - there is a really good chance the you will discover new ways and create new capabilities.  Will and Hannah are both clear that they are not PTs or MDs, but they are insanely good at assessing and improving movement.  They are insanely good at figuring out how to work with the skills and capabilities that you have right now in order to progress to greater fluidity of movement.  They also get that healing and growing aren't always linear or logical. \u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n3.  Finally, if you are working toward a specific goal - especially a movement or athletic goal - you want them on your team.  Period.

Try taking your kitchen table for a walk--it'll surely \"stay upright\", but it's not going anywhere fast.\n\nFinally, as you pick-up the items of your life, chat with other humans, and think thoughts, notice how effortlessly you *keep* your balance through it all.\n\nSure, you may stumble or trip now and then, but for the most part your head stays over your feet.\n\nAnd somehow, you don't automatically keel over the minute your attention leaves your upright-ness.\n\nThis is a magic trick that we perform daily.\n\nNext time you hear that inner voice trying to convince you that you are not enough--not strong or fast enough, not fluid or expressive enough--remember your magic.\n\nRemember how difficult sitting upright was when you were 6mos old, how incredible running felt when you were 4, and how inspiring a great dance partner can be.\n\nRemember that we all have the capacity for magic, right here, right now.\n\n#toYourResilience\n#everydaymagic\n#allbodieswelcome"

It was a great investment.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nThen I read an article called \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat You Call Internalized Fatphobia Might Be Internalized Dominance\u00e2\u0080\u009d by @yrfatfriend and everything fell into place.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWill and I have always been thin or \"straight sized,\" which means we cannot be oppressed by Fatphobia, or even have internalized fatphobia.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWe can (and for sure do) have body insecurity that is fueled by diet culture and fatphobia.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nBut that is a key distinction.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nIf you are wrestling with your own body image, if you are wanting to opt out of diet culture, if you are a thin person who would like to be an ally to fat folx, I really encourage you to read the article linked in our bio (it'll be up there through this weekend), and start filling up your IG feed with fat babes focused on this topic.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u0099\u00a5\u00ef\u00b8\u008f @hannahhusband\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#HealthAtEverySize\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BefriendYourBody\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies"

Very often, this ability is actually critical to creating continuity in her art-making, but it can also obscure subtle signals from the body.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nIn training, on the other hand, our focus is entirely on looking for, reading, and responding to those very body-signals. That's the only way we can start to unwrap the years of patterning that have gotten us the joints and tissues that we have *today*.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAs we talked through her insight, she reflected that she wasn't aware of the strategy her body was adopting for the given exercise, even though she didn't feel totally connected with the movement.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nIt took an invitation (permission?) from her coach--me--to try a simplified variation of the move. Only then was she able to see the threat of that more complex exercise for what it was: just a few steps further down the path of progression than her nervous system was ready for.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAgain, this dynamic of finding the exercise that's the right level of complexity for *you* is a hard truth for everyone of us; but it's particularly striking to witness a world-class mover, who CAN figure out nearly every movement laid before her, start to see the importance of working where *she* is, today.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWay to go Marlie!\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n- @welew_\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nCurious about becoming a 'Sponsored Mover' with us?

    "title": "CHANGE is one of those blue-chip buzzwords that seemingly everyone can support.\n\nBut in the world of PHYSICAL change-making (fitness, yes, but also all the related health and wellness spheres), change can be divided neatly into two types: short-term and long-term.\n\nAs in, changes that last and those that don't.\n\nIt's such an important distinction because quite often the short-term changes, the ones that *don't last*, leave an obvious indication of change that truly fucks with our perspective.\n\nThat's what you're seeing in the first slide above, which shows the impression my watch left on my skin after crossing my arms for a couple minutes (while doing spinal CARs), and then the same arm 3 minutes later when the impression is gone.\n\nBut let's face it: it's down-right tough to ignore how a calming massage or a satisfying chiropractic adjustment can leave us with a clear internal sense that something HAS in fact changed.\n\nAnd while these kind of momentary changes can be beneficial in the short-term, they're quite distinct from the kind of change that most people are ultimately looking for: a back that doesn't hurt any more, legs that don't get tired as quickly, the mobility to get down (and back up) from the floor, etc.\n\nTo do that--to make long-term, lasting changes--you need to employ methods that are clear and consistent, and target the *specific* thing that you're trying to change.\n\nSays #science.\n\nAnd that's what you see happening in the second slide, as I work through yet another spinal CAR, after years of doing them daily.\n\nThe challenge comes down to how *obvious* the change feels, because in a weird way, the more consistent you are (and therefore the more clearly you are prompting your body to change) the less *novel* the experience is and therefore the less clearly you can consciously clock the change in the moment.\n\nI'll leave you with a question...How do you perceive changes in/to your body?\n\n#befriendyourbody\n#makeshitworknice\n#fitnessbyfeel\n#bodytrust\n#fitness\n#onlinetraining\n#allbodieswelcome",

That is they cannot do these things *until* they have a foot-hold of bodily SAFETY.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nThis is why racism intersects so clearly with the other -isms and -phobias, and how able-ism sits at the root of all of it.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nUntil someone feels safe to exist *as they are*, they are not really free (Thanks to Ilya Parker for helping us see this connection! @decolonizingfitness ).\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nSo whether we're gradually teaching someone how to trust their spine after a decade of back pain, or we're writing a social media post about what should be baseline truth (\"Black lives matter\") in this, the wealthiest country in the world, we are intent on promoting the simple power of feeling safe inside your body.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#antiracism\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#InDefenseOfBlackLives\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#UnlearnAndRelearn\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#amplifymelanatedvoices\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#socialjustice\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#racialjustice"

(That's what you see happening in the video of Coach @hannahhusband above).\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n@Kinstretch is one scientifically proven way to do just that. High intensity workouts are not.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nChoose the tool you need for the physical changes that are important to YOU.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#FuckItFriday\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BodyLiberation\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BefriendYourBody\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#fitnessforall\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodieswelcome\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#bodytrust\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#jointhealth\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#LiveByFeel\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#FitnessbyFeel\n#kinstretch\n#kinstretchwiththefitnessalchemists \n#virtualtraining\n#onlinetraining"

A #MovementSnack if you will...\n\nSometimes that felt like swinging my arms--fast and coordinated, or slow and articulated--as I looked and danced my way around random rest areas. Actually, that happened at MOST rest areas, despite the numerous raised eyebrows \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3.\n\nAnd whereas in the past, I would bemoan the random aches and pains of travel even as I felt underlying shame about not finding the space/time/motivation for 'regular workouts', this summer I took a new tack and just ... MOVED, whenever/wherever I felt like it.\n\nLuckily I had @debbbbiee with me to capture a few of these moments, and others I'll be sharing over the next couple weeks.\n\nIn each situation, the little 'bite' of movement worked in a sneaky but powerful way, keeping me enlivened during the long drives AND allowing me to dive right in whenever life offered more of a movement MEAL.\n\nBy the end of the summer, I felt more embodied, more grounded, than I perhaps *ever* have.

It is NOT directed from the top down.\n\nFor many horses who have been brushed aside as 'bad movers' or lazy, or even irretrievably 'broken', a shift toward this kind of training can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nAnd I think the same is true for humans.\n\nAnything else--like highly-cued, over-explained directions (for humans) or negative-reinforcement (for horses)--is AT BEST a shoddy stand-in for that kind of unimpeded movement mastery, and at worst a sick kind of abuse that denies the animal's birthright to MOVE.\n\nAnd while the mechanism here is tricky and takes an experienced teacher/coach/trainer to really make work, the bottom-line is downright *inspring*: all of us have this intrinsic capacity for solving complex movement problems IF we have the right context.\n\nSo this #MotivationMonday I invite you to 'try on' seeing yourself as a graceful, magnificent mover in search of the right context, and nothing less. \u00f0\u009f\u0090\u008e\n\n#befriendyourbody\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies\n#AffirmingFitness\n#InclusiveFitness"

You get to hold onto all that understanding; your efforts compound over time.\n\nOne weird part about this language is that it isn't spoken and heard, but is actually in the form of mechanical forces: tension and stretch, sensation and motion.\n\n\"Force is the language of our cells,\" as @drandreospina has been saying for years.\n\nOf course, there is always another option: turn away from knowing how your body communicates, and skip the crucial steps in learning how to speak BODY.\n\nBut that almost always leads to a scenario where our body resorts to the equivalent of yelling and screaming, which in BODY-speak shows up as pain and dysfunction.\n\nAll too often, this leads to quick-fixes to get out of pain that don't really address the underlying causes.\n\nPretty soon, the yelling starts again, and round and round we go.\n\nWhich is why we so strongly encourage YOU to say #FuckItFriday and leave aside the societal bullshit telling you how or why you *should/shouldn't* move in a certain way, and instead start communicating directly with *your* sweet, incredible body.\n\nIt has a lot to share.\n\n#BodyLiberation\n#BefriendYourBody\n#AntiDiet\n#HealthAtEverySize\n#SmashTheHierarchy\n#fitnessforall\n#allbodieswelcome\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies\n#bodytrust\n#jointhealth\n#LiveByFeel\n#FitnessbyFeel\n#FindYourJoy"

Pick a strength move you like (one that is \"in your wheelhouse\")\n...one that makes you feel powerful\n...doesn't cause pain or threat\n...that you actaully look forward to doing!\n\n2. Set a timer for 10 minutes\n...use your phone timer, couting down, so you can see how much time is elapsed/remaining\n...you can use a fancy timer app, but you don't need one!\n\n3. Every minute, on the minute, do X reps of your strength move\n...choose the reps based on what feels totally do-able\n...it should leave you at least 30 seconds of rest before the next minute starts (doesn't have to be exact -- fire your inner perfectionist for this one, k?)\n\n4.

And we did!\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nBut the more we learned and the more we worked with folx, the more we realized there were TWO gaps in our approach:\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n- most people are deeply disconnected from their physical selves\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n- much of that disconnection is driven by faulty societal norms based on fatphobia (which is itself based on ableism and white supremacy)\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nThe journey of unpacking these distinct-but-related questions bring us to TODAY:\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWe love coaching people all over the place (all of our coaching is online now) in the magical possibilities of applying a scientifically-sound approach to MOVING and FEELING how *THEY* want to.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nWe're glad that you're here!\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#RethinkFitness\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BodyAlly\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BefriendYourBody\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#AntiDiet\n#InclusiveFitness\n#AffirmingFitness"

ENOUGH?\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAs in, \"hard enough\"? or \"change-making enough\"?\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nThese are questions that have dogged me for years, and still do. In many cases, I have spent more time on the wondering then on the actual moving... which is odd \u00f0\u009f\u00a7\u0090 haha.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAfter lots of pondering, and even more hard-just-cuz-it's-hard training, these questions finally dissolved into a bigger one:\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Where do I get my understanding of \"enough\" from?\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Who or what has determined what is \"enough\", for *ME*?\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAnd while I don't generally have a clear answer to that question, I have come to realize that simply *attempting* to answer it has brought me more movement JOY than any amount of \"enough-chasing\" ever did.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nThis is because exploring a question like that can only be done by actually moving your body, and beginning to notice your edges.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nYour experience, after all, is wholly yours.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nAnd as I began to explore my edges in this way, to contend with the limits of my strength/endurance/ability/etc, I began to realize that the next step--to nurture and expand those edges--felt like a logical, obvious next step.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nI also realized that these challenging, physical efforts were actually a joyful experience IF I was truly engaged with noticing, honoring, and expanind my edges. As soon as I just went through the motions, and worked hard to satisfy some external goal, the joy dissolved.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nSo for this #FuckItFriday I want to lift up the idea that challenging, demanding training can be a reflection of YOUR journey, the exploration of YOUR boundaries, and not an attempt at living up some external definition of ENOUGH.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\nCuz you are already way, way more than ENOUGH.\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#FuckItFriday\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BodyLiberation\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#BefriendYourBody\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#AntiDiet\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#fitnessforall\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#allbodieswelcome\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#bodytrust\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#jointhealth\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#LiveByFeel\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#FitnessbyFeel\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#FindYourJoy\u00e2\u00a0\u0080\n#Fitness"

    "title": "This is always important to remember, whether you're just getting started with building a movement practice, or you have a nicely seasoned approach. Change simply cannot and does not happen without STRESS.\n\nNow ... of course there are caveats here. Like if you're already in a state of chronic stress, and you simply think *adding* a stressful workout to the system will magically make the background life stressors feel easy (hint: it won't).\n\nAnd this is why Kathy Sierra ( @pantherflows on IG ) talks about incorporating more down-regulating methods ('calming') ALONGSIDE up-regulating methods ('stress') to help *her* movers--who are horses--get moving.\n\nBut what is non-negotiable is that there must be some clear prompt (aka stress) for your body-system to change, some signal for it to organize around, if it is to make ANY change. In fact, one of the biggest pitfalls I see with human movers (and what Kathy talks about in her work), is actually making the movement 'ask' TOO easy for the mover.\n\nIf your strategy is always to make the 'ask' easier in the face of resistance, and not lean into the stressor a little bit, you will pretty quickly make like Kathy's horses and simply not care much about it anymore. Because the ask has been whittled down to something that just doesn't matter. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00b7\u00e2\u0080\u008d\u00e2\u0099\u0082\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\nAnd last thing? Kathy Sierra is SO COOL, and her work is mega-interesting and inspiring to me (remember, she trains horses! and I know almost nothing about horses! but the overlaps between our worlds are spooky and amazing). Thanks to @hathaequus for helping me really see and feel this connection!\n\n#MotivationMonday\n#MakeShitWorkNice\n#MovementScience\n#EcologicalDynamics\n#NonlinearPedagogy\n#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies\n#BefriendYourBody",

LONG.\n\nThere is something so essentially human behind the particulars of good 'coaching communication' tactics, and I love it.\n\nEven the most inexperienced personal trainer realizes pretty quickly how impactful the words (choice, sequence, etc) used to describe and cue a drill can be on the literal movements your clients make.\n\nBut take this insight through the kind of career that @_stevekerr_ has had, and set it loose among some of the most high-level athletes in the world (the @Warriors ) and you have the mix for some truly special communication strategies to develop.\n\nSo when he dropped this little gem describing his approach to basketball mid-conversation with Jon Stewart (which is great, you can find it on YouTube) I immediately jotted it down.\n\nAs Coach Kerr unpacks the idea with Jon, it's clear that he's taken great care to find the *right* words to convey a complex idea--about balance and liberty within a structure--quickly and effectively to his team.\n\nBut I guess his motto resonated so quickly with me really because, after watching an unhealthy amount of Warriors basketball over the past few years, I can fully attest that this is *exactly* how the Warriors play: Fast, Loose, and Disciplined.\n\n...and it's breath-taking to watch, especially with @klaythompson back \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e!

These looping lines are all different, and map different 'paths' through the possible option-space, but they are NOT random by any means; they conform to constraints that dicatate the size and shape formed by repeated 'solutions' to the task. \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u0093\n\nSlide 3 shows the shoulder (GH) structures, especially the capsule, that actually 'recieve' the inputs of training and then relay that mechanical information to the brain. If we can gradually diminish the internal contraint of joint immobility, we can 'solve' movement tasks in more ways (essentially, imagine larger loops in the 2nd slide \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008c).\n\nSlide 4: There is unfathomable variation available within each of us, if only we can tap into it, and develop it. Magically (but also quite scientifically) our internal world follows the same principles that we see at work in the external world, in situations like weather and flocks of birds. In each instance, it is the *variation*, the differences between the parts, that contribute to the overall health of the whole.\n\n#FitnessByFeel\n#MakeShitWorkNice\n#InclusiveFitness\n#BodyLiberation\n#BodyTrust\n#BefriendYourBody\n#ConversationsWithMyBody\n#AllBodiesWelcome\n#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies\n#FindYourJoy\n#SmashTheHierarchy",

They are literally the reason we exist as a company.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6not to teach squats, or mobility exercises, or help you improve at a sport or competitive pursuit. Those are all just means to an end, an external manifestation of internal change.\n\nIn my opinion, it's the internal shift, toward feeling more at home in your body, that is the critical WHY behind doing any sort of physical training at all.\n\nBut it's also at the center of what is taken from people when they are oppressed, which is why we want to help bring more of these things to the world:\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Body Liberation\n\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Sovereignty of Subjective Experience\n\u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0089 Agency\n\nSwipe for a zoomed-in view of how the movement components of our approach feed the internal, psycho-emotional shifts.\n\n- @welew_ \n\n#antiracism\n#InDefenseOfBlackLives\n#UnlearnAndRelearn\n#amplifymelanatedvoices\n#socialjustice\n#racialjustice\n#SmashTheHierarchy\n#BodyLiberation\n#BefriendYourBody",

As I learned today, biking around with some of the residents of these rich and historic communities of color, many of these folx have never ventured across the freeway to the stretch of bay shoreline that glitters so close.\n\nThe richness of this kind of green space, and the sensual relaxation that it offers, is sorely missed in many of the neighboring communities that have, for so long, housed the most toxic industries while receiving the least portion of community care and collective support.\n\nAnd serving as an immediate and obvious example of this environmental injustice, the literal route to get from one side of East Oakland to the other is about as challenging to navigate--by any means--as I can imagine: fast/bad traffic, few bike lanes, exhaust-filled air, potholes, glass, etc etc. Safe is the last way I would describe it.\n\nSo the @EastOaklandCollective organized a bike ride this morning *thru* this problem. Led by reps from several local organziations, about 40 of us bikers met up at Liberation Park and moved en masse (and v safely \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008c) thru the neighborhoods, across the industrial areas, over the on-ramps and railroad tracks, and into the peace of the shoreline.\n\nToday, as we all biked together to the Bay, I was so aware of how mobility--the literal ability to move around your world--is inextricably linked to the ways that we are able to form the communities that determine the quality of our lives.\n\nThe ride was part of the larger Power the People initiative which is spearheaded by the brilliant minds at @EastOaklandCollective . I really recommend checking it out whether you live nearby or not--it's a super interesting project (a google search will get you there \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d).\n\n- @welew_\n\n#antiracism\n#InDefenseOfBlackLives\n#UnlearnAndRelearn\n#amplifymelanatedvoices\n#socialjustice\n#racialjustice\n#SmashTheHierarchy",

It's much more than that: it's how we interact with the physical world.\n\nSo each time I was able to submerge (or even dip a toe in) this summer, I did it.

Specifically--objects, or implements, that serve to extend our bodies thru the addition of tools.\n\nIn a sense, these moments were all about exploring the *affordances* of the world around me; what becomes available to us (movement-wise) when we imagine objects and context in a purposefully different way?\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a5 Walk the Kettlebell, any-style\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a5 Random Object Lift\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a5 UnCar Yourself with a hefty iron friend\n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a5 Play Hit the Rock at sunset \n\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00a5 Tell that driftwood to Flip Off\n\nAnd how do these every day invitations for play//exploration//effortful pleasure change as our joints become more capable?\n\nMmm, tasty questions for a tasty topic...\n\nThis summer really had me living into all the ways that movement-joy opportunities grow all around us, like blueberries at knee height.\n\nThe richness is in the noticing.\n\n- Coach @welew_ \n\n#TryThisTuesday\n#ToYourResilience\n#Kinstretch\n#KinstretchwithTheFitnessAlchemists\n#AtHomeWorkout #bodyliberation\n#BodyTrust #befriendyourbody\n#allbodieswelcome\n#allbodiesaregoodbodies\n#FitnessbyFeel\n#FindYourJoy",

And\u00e2\u0080\u0094most crucially\u00e2\u0080\u0094the knowledge that you CAN change yourself.\n\nBecause armed with those things, you have equipped yourself to navigate the deep waters of *healing yourself*.\n\nAnd without even delving into the more abstract ways that emotional and spirtual healing happens after an injury, the power of self-knowledge becomes real when you start making your CONTEXT work for you.\n\nLike in the video above, taken as we flew down the highway in Arkansas.  @debbbbiee is giving her knee the inputs ( #ControlledArticularRotations ) it needs to come back into being the bona-fide KNEE that she wants and k-needs \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a9 , right from the passenger seat of the car.\n\nSoundtrack is rockin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 too \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u008e.\n\nBecause she knows how to give these inputs to HERSELF (and not only through the hands of a provider), Debbie is now able to guide her own tissue-adaptation process, wherever she might be.\n\nSo often, recovering from an injury makes us humans feel LESS capable and LESS trusting of our incredible, ever-adapting bodies, even if we eventually succeed at making the ouchie go away.\n\nBut when you can flip that script, and grab hold of the ways that you *can* guide your body into a version that works better for you--wherever you are--healing yourself becomes an exercise in empowerment.\n\nAddressing your injured joints and tissue in this way is not just about the arrival point (HEALED) but actually is an opportunity to shift how you relate to your own biology.\n\n- Coach @welew_\n\n#ThinkyThursday\n#FitnessByFeel\n#InclusiveFitness\n#AskBetterQuestions\n#BodyLiberation\n#BodyTrust\n#BefriendYourBody\n#ConversationsWithMyBody\n#AllBodiesWelcome\n#AllBodiesAreGoodBodies\n#FindYourJoy\n#SmashTheHierarchy"
