Even if you\u2019re \u201cusually\u201d pretty good about drinking water, a single day of low fluid intake (\u201cI forgot my water bottle!\u201d is the classic excuse we hear...) can have outsize effects on your workouts, your recovery (sleep) and your general well-being. So drink up! <strong>Keep a reusable water bottle with you at all times.</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While most people will describe themselves as \u201cnormal\u201d eaters of protein, their actual intake varies widely, as do specific needs (a 200lb guy who wants to put the hurt on in Jiu-Jitsu class has different needs than a 130lb woman who wants to lose 5 pounds of fat). Low protein intake can make you feel weak, sore, and even affect hormone levels in a not-so-fun way. <strong>On a daily basis, aim for at least 1 gram of protein per kilogram of bodyweight.</strong> This metric comes from the clinical world (thus the annoying conversion to metric), but is an excellent place to start.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If there\u2019s one thing that about 99.4% of the fitness and nutrition coaching world can agree on it is this: vegetables rock, and you should eat them. <strong>Prioritize the leafy and green variety, but seriously, eat at least 2 big servings of veggies a day.</strong></p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tell the low-fat voices in your head to shut the hell up. Proper fat intake is critical to literally hundreds of process body-wide, and it can be the difference maker for people with all types of goals from fat-loss to muscle gain and everything between. <strong>Aim for 2 thumb-size servings of healthy fats at every meal;</strong> as Coach Hannah says with loving insistence: \u201cFear not the fat!\u201d</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sugar should be an occasional treat, not a staple. This one is tough, as it runs contrary to the typical North-American diet, but it makes a really, really big difference. Limiting sugar helps you in so many ways, not least of which is feeling your true hunger cues--which helps you naturally manage portion size, and can be the difference-maker for people trying to lose body fat. On the performance side, athletes often report experiencing less soreness as their sugar (and overall carb) intake drops. <strong>Limit refined sugar intake to special occasions.</strong></p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>Next time you\u2019re looking ahead to your next workout, and wondering how you should prepare for and recover from it, check and see if the items above are a regular part of your lifestyle. If you can make a small shift in most of your meals (and not just pre/post workout), you\u2019ll notice big changes in your body and performance. Rather than feeling constricted to eating a super-specific thing pre- or post-workout, feel free to eat whatever you want! ...so long as it includes adequate protein, some veggies, healthy fat, and minimal refined sugar, alongside plenty of water (see what I did there?).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>As you can imagine, the hard part of any lifestyle change is not getting the right information--it\u2019s implementing that information day in and day out. Staying disciplined and consistent over time is not an easy slam-dunk. Having a coach to guide your process can keep you on track, help you fine tune, and ultimately be the the differentiator between a moment of \u201cdieting\u201d and a lifetime of feeding yourself well.

This metric comes from the clinical world (thus the annoying conversion to metric), but is an excellent place to start.If theres one thing that about 99.4% of the fitness and nutrition coaching world can agree on it is this: vegetables rock, and you should eat them. Prioritize the leafy and green variety, but seriously, eat at least 2 big servings of veggies a day.Tell the low-fat voices in your head to shut the hell up. Proper fat intake is critical to literally hundreds of process body-wide, and it can be the difference maker for people with all types of goals from fat-loss to muscle gain and everything between. Aim for 2 thumb-size servings of healthy fats at every meal; as Coach Hannah says with loving insistence: Fear not the fat!Sugar should be an occasional treat, not a staple. This one is tough, as it runs contrary to the typical North-American diet, but it makes a really, really big difference. Limiting sugar helps you in so many ways, not least of which is feeling your true hunger cues--which helps you naturally manage portion size, and can be the difference-maker for people trying to lose body fat. On the performance side, athletes often report experiencing less soreness as their sugar (and overall carb) intake drops. Limit refined sugar intake to special occasions.Next time youre looking ahead to your next workout, and wondering how you should prepare for and recover from it, check and see if the items above are a regular part of your lifestyle. If you can make a small shift in most of your meals (and not just pre/post workout), youll notice big changes in your body and performance. Rather than feeling constricted to eating a super-specific thing pre- or post-workout, feel free to eat whatever you want! ...so long as it includes adequate protein, some veggies, healthy fat, and minimal refined sugar, alongside plenty of water (see what I did there?).As you can imagine, the hard part of any lifestyle change is not getting the right information--its implementing that information day in and day out. Staying disciplined and consistent over time is not an easy slam-dunk. Having a coach to guide your process can keep you on track, help you fine tune, and ultimately be the the differentiator between a moment of dieting and a lifetime of feeding yourself well. Our one-on-one nutrition coaching is dedicated to working with you where you are now in order to make big changes.

Blank slate, fresh start, New You! Also known as: where best intentions go to die.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sorry for the bleak perspective, but that's just reality for those of us in the Fit Biz.&nbsp;January is too often the time when lovely, admirable intentions are made (January 1), acted on (January 2) and then abandoned (January 5). By the end of the month, we're usually back to our regularly scheduled programming, and feeling very much like we did the year before.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But for <em>some</em>&nbsp;people, that totally arbitrary line-in-the-sand that is January 1 actually kicks off a shift. The flip of the calendar page plants seeds that, with focus and perspiration, <em>will</em> bear tangible fruit for them. What makes these people different?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Well, first, they have a plan. They have broken down their resolutions/visions/dreams into constituent steps, and laid out a path that connects those steps. They have systematically backtracked, from the new, shiny person that they imagine their 2017-selves to be, all the way back to who they are <em>right now</em>. What do the steps in between <strong>Now</strong> and <strong>New</strong> look like? Where will they be at the end of January? February? And most crucially, what will change <em>immediately</em> in service of their long-term, change-erific goal?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That last question brings us to the second indicator: successful Resolutioners make the center-piece of their resolution an actionable goal that can start on January 2.

        "raw_content": "         Well, it's that time of year again.January.Resolution season. Blank slate, fresh start, New You! Also known as: where best intentions go to die.Sorry for the bleak perspective, but that's just reality for those of us in the Fit Biz.January is too often the time when lovely, admirable intentions are made (January 1), acted on (January 2) and then abandoned (January 5). By the end of the month, we're usually back to our regularly scheduled programming, and feeling very much like we did the year before.But for somepeople, that totally arbitrary line-in-the-sand that is January 1 actually kicks off a shift. The flip of the calendar page plants seeds that, with focus and perspiration, will bear tangible fruit for them. What makes these people different?Well, first, they have a plan. They have broken down their resolutions/visions/dreams into constituent steps, and laid out a path that connects those steps. They have systematically backtracked, from the new, shiny person that they imagine their 2017-selves to be, all the way back to who they are right now. What do the steps in between Now and New look like? Where will they be at the end of January? February? And most crucially, what will change immediately in service of their long-term, change-erific goal?That last question brings us to the second indicator: successful Resolutioners make the center-piece of their resolution an actionable goal that can start on January 2. However small it might be, they determine to enact a small, (usually) daily act of resistanceto their own status-quo. This is the gardener deciding to start weeding and pruning their garden every week, the artist deciding to sketch every day, or the yogi deciding to do 3 sun salutations every morning.They have found a tiny seam in their regular hum-drum, a tiny glimpse into the future, and they have resolvedto hone in on it with precision and doggedness.This is a huge step. Only by clarifying their grand notions into regular and actionable chunks--chunks that they can truly imagine baking into the rest of their lives--do these people enact actual change over the long haul.Finally, one more thing is at work for these Successful Resolutioners. They realize, sometimes for the first time, that even at their lowest, even when facing their biggest obstacle, they have one major factor foreverin their favor: change is already happening. It might be described generally, as entropy (the gradual and universal tendency toward chaos), or specifically (e.g. the protein-turnover of our muscles), but realize that life is progressing and evolving and changingall around us (despite us!),all the time.Successful Resolutioners harness that power. Like an experienced gardener, they have realized that progress looks more like cultivation than creation. Each day (and not just January 1) is a culmination of what has come beforeanda threshold into the opportunity of what comes next; our role as changers is to intervene only as much as that intervention helps.As a gardener myself, I love the garden as an analogy for change (and have written about it before). I love how succinctly it captures the magic of progress: given the right conditions, plants just grow. I think humans are the same.This perspective is not very mainstream these days, but it gets to the very center of a compassionate approach to changing yourself.

        "raw_content": "Taco bowls are the best, you guys. Easy? Check. Delicious? Check. Packed with nutrients? Check. Customizable to your hearts content? Check. Best of all, you can whip one up in under 20 minutes. Here's how...          I first started making them back in 2010, when I realized I had a gluten sensitivity. If you are following a gluten-free, low-carb, or Paleo diet, or if you are just trying to eat more real food and less processed food, the Taco Bowl is your ticket to feeling full and satisfied.Heres my formula...1. Start with a big a$$ bowl.Like, one you could fit your whole face in.2. Fill your bowl to the half-way point with leaves.Leaves? Yes, leaves. Green leafy vegetables are an essential component of human health. This is something ALL diet philosophies can agree on. The darker green, the more nutritional benefits. You can choose from eitherA) Raw leaves  these work well and require almost no prep (Except washing):LettuceArugulaBaby SpinachDress your raw greens with a little EVOO, lime juice, and salt.orB) Cooked leaves:Roasted Brussels sproutsSauted Cabbage (red or green)Braised Kale or collard greensRoasted KaleWilted SpinachNote: This is great opportunity to use leftovers!3. Cook up your Protein of choice + Taco Seasoning:Grassfed ground beefthis is my go-to protein choiceGround turkeyHeat your skillet to medium-high. Melt 1tsp of your fat of choice (my faves are clarified butter, coconut oil or bacon fat) add your taco seasonings to the pan (use a pre-made blend, or combing equal parts Cumin and Chili Powder, with a few dashes of garlic powder.Crumble in the ground meat with your hands, and stir like you mean it to combine seasonings thoroughly. Keep stirring, and breaking apart chunks, until there are no pink parts left. Immediately turn off the heat once the last pink has disappeared, because dry meat is not the championship.Now it's time to add salt + pepper to taste. The \"to taste\" part is really important--TASTE your meat. If it doesn't taste AMAZING, you probably need to add a little more salt. Salt will activate the other spices and flavors --read more about the essential role of salt.Let skillet contents rest as you assemble your other ingredients.4.

As a fitness company, the choice of exercises in our workouts is central to who we are; it is quite literally <em>what</em>&nbsp;we do, and one of the main ways that we express what we believe to be important about training bodies to be strong. In an effort to \"pull back the curtain\", this blog is about <strong>why, what, and how</strong>&nbsp;these workouts are structured and organized, and what this means about our company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<hr /><p style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\"><strong>WHY</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fitness is, on its face, about helping people achieve real, meaningful changes to their bodies, health, and capabilities. It's about improving weaknesses, functioning <em>better</em>, and living more richly. With that promise, fitness grabs our collective attention as an alluring and fulfilling goal, something worth investing real time, money, and focus.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As with any investment, we care about the results; in fact, the more we invest, the more we care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we care about the \"return\" on our investment--what has changed--but, because it's <em>our</em>&nbsp;sweat turning the crank,&nbsp;we also care how it feels getting there. So if we care so much, and have invested so deeply, shouldn't we also care about the tools we're using to get there?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We think so. Our bodies are incredible--amazing, shape-shifting, task-switching, adaptive machines--and will respond to nearly any stress that we're exposed to. However, making sure that stress-response is the same change that we wanted in the first place (stronger, healthier, richer life) means three components must be treated carefully:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Direction of progress must be clearly established.</strong> This means that the trainer(s) and trainee have agreed on what a successful return on their investment will look like, 6 months or more down the road. This is why we are adamant about bringing all of our trainees on board with a thorough 1-on-1 assessment, and why we meet 1-on-1 with clients throughout their training.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Progress must be real. </strong>There's already plenty of bluster and fake-news in the world, and your sweaty, consistent effort need not add to it. Instead, let the cold, hard numbers of regular re-assessment do the talking, and relax knowing that your growth process is truly managed (and not just given lip-service).</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum</strong>. Real people, with real lives, must learn to expect the unexpected and plan to be surprised. Therefore, one sign of a smart training approach is that it takes unpredictability into account, and streamlines accordingly. While we might be inclined to try and \"do it all\" (in the gym or in our lives), a much better approach is to choose the most important components and <em>commit </em>to them.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We designed our new programming engine (it's an algorithmic web-app) to synthesize these demands.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<hr /><p style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\"><strong>WHAT</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This tool generates multi-month cycles of weekly workouts that judiciously allocates training time to the specific parameters we've defined (and that we've committed to assessing), while leaving space for the in-session, day-to-day flexibility required by our real-lives/real-bodies. Striking that balance is no small task. In fact, that balance is <em>the</em>&nbsp;thing that matters if you care about long-term, substantive change.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Speaking of change, the challenges that people face are not for lack of trying. Step into a gym anywhere in the world and there will be three kinds of people:</p><ol data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>People who are doing a bunch of random sh*t</strong>: These folks have achieved the first and most challenging task: showing up. Beyond that, they are rolling the dice on their investment. This group includes 75% of group-fitness class attendees, as well (as former group-class instructors, you can trust us on this one). This group has sometimes been been duped by the \"you have to keep your body guessing\" Workout Confusion Theory approach to training.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>People who are following a plan</strong>: These trainees have committed themselves to something longer-term, something progressive, something strict. Assuming that commitment is toward something that is <em>meaningful </em>for them (actually, a very difficult thing to measure/observe), the challenge with this approach is three-fold:<em> </em><strong><em>motivation</em></strong> (executing this kind of plan, alone, takes a lot of will-power), <strong><em>flexibility</em> </strong>(what if things <em>don't </em>go according to plan), and <strong><em>program drop-off</em></strong> (\"Ok, I've finished the plan! ... What now?\"). Just <em>having </em>a plan doesn't mean your progress is automatic.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>People who intuitively and continuously improve</strong>: These are usually the most-experienced trainees, people who have been around the block (and seen their share of dead-ends, injuries, and time-sucks). Three or four times a week, they show up, listen to their bodies, and push themselves (or hold back) accordingly. Through years of consistent training, they know what works and what doesn't, and like the Earth moves around the sun, they <em>make progress</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></p></li></ol><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We built our programming engine as a tool to help bridge the gaps between these three distinct groups. By combining the strict, quantifiable <em>results</em> of a plan (group 2) with a flexible, quality-focused approach (and expert coaching), we help those in group 1, who are a little lost in their fitness-lives* learn to train in the intuitive way of that compelling third group.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While the actual workouts may vary greatly from day-to-day (and won't feel much different from previous workouts to our current clients), they are now guided with precision to get right to the important stuff, as efficiently as possible.</p>\n\n\n<hr /><p style=\"text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;\" class=\"\"><strong>HOW</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, here's our formula for success:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-hidden\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:915px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:14.207651138305664%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;\n              \"\n              >\n              <noscript><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56ff0dfef850820e70a8b93f/1503509501673-1FIMXF37DDWH6QOHA7RQ/TFA_successFormula.png\" alt=\"TFA_successFormula.png\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56ff0dfef850820e70a8b93f/1503509501673-1FIMXF37DDWH6QOHA7RQ/TFA_successFormula.png\" data-image=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56ff0dfef850820e70a8b93f/1503509501673-1FIMXF37DDWH6QOHA7RQ/TFA_successFormula.png\" data-image-dimensions=\"915x130\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"TFA_successFormula.png\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"599dbbfdc534a51e5741be92\" data-type=\"image\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Like any tool, this new programming engine is only effective in the right hands.

This is why we are adamant about bringing all of our trainees on board with a thorough 1-on-1 assessment, and why we meet 1-on-1 with clients throughout their training.Progress must be real. There's already plenty of bluster and fake-news in the world, and your sweaty, consistent effort need not add to it. Instead, let the cold, hard numbers of regular re-assessment do the talking, and relax knowing that your growth process is truly managed (and not just given lip-service).Progress doesn't happen in a vacuum. Real people, with real lives, must learn to expect the unexpected and plan to be surprised. Therefore, one sign of a smart training approach is that it takes unpredictability into account, and streamlines accordingly. While we might be inclined to try and \"do it all\" (in the gym or in our lives), a much better approach is to choose the most important components and commit to them.We designed our new programming engine (it's an algorithmic web-app) to synthesize these demands. WHATThis tool generates multi-month cycles of weekly workouts that judiciously allocates training time to the specific parameters we've defined (and that we've committed to assessing), while leaving space for the in-session, day-to-day flexibility required by our real-lives/real-bodies. Striking that balance is no small task. In fact, that balance is thething that matters if you care about long-term, substantive change.Speaking of change, the challenges that people face are not for lack of trying. Step into a gym anywhere in the world and there will be three kinds of people:People who are doing a bunch of random sh*t: These folks have achieved the first and most challenging task: showing up. Beyond that, they are rolling the dice on their investment. This group includes 75% of group-fitness class attendees, as well (as former group-class instructors, you can trust us on this one). This group has sometimes been been duped by the \"you have to keep your body guessing\" Workout Confusion Theory approach to training.People who are following a plan: These trainees have committed themselves to something longer-term, something progressive, something strict. Assuming that commitment is toward something that is meaningful for them (actually, a very difficult thing to measure/observe), the challenge with this approach is three-fold: motivation (executing this kind of plan, alone, takes a lot of will-power), flexibility (what if things don't go according to plan), and program drop-off (\"Ok, I've finished the plan! ... What now?\"). Just having a plan doesn't mean your progress is automatic.People who intuitively and continuously improve: These are usually the most-experienced trainees, people who have been around the block (and seen their share of dead-ends, injuries, and time-sucks). Three or four times a week, they show up, listen to their bodies, and push themselves (or hold back) accordingly. Through years of consistent training, they know what works and what doesn't, and like the Earth moves around the sun, they make progress.We built our programming engine as a tool to help bridge the gaps between these three distinct groups. By combining the strict, quantifiable results of a plan (group 2) with a flexible, quality-focused approach (and expert coaching), we help those in group 1, who are a little lost in their fitness-lives* learn to train in the intuitive way of that compelling third group.While the actual workouts may vary greatly from day-to-day (and won't feel much different from previous workouts to our current clients), they are now guided with precision to get right to the important stuff, as efficiently as possible. HOWSo, here's our formula for success:          Like any tool, this new programming engine is only effective in the right hands. By combining the tuned-in, emotionally-intelligent coaching that The Fitness Alchemists are known for with a way of generating workouts that reflects what is actually important, we can be sure that clients are given their best chance to succeed. Letting the computer do the detailed work of balancing inputs and crafting schedules means that our coaches have more band-width and energy to help clients with that critical \"doing it well\" component.Curious about what making real changes feels like?

For those who know me, you know I love to sleep. I do best with 8+ hours per night, every night. So I\u2019m not making mornings happen by sacrificing sleep. Mama don\u2019t play that sleep dep game. I\u2019m hilarious when sleep deprived, but otherwise non-functional and I quickly get overwhelmed and think that the world is terrible and everything is wrong and it will never get better so let\u2019s just eat M&amp;Ms and potato chips until we die.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><br>Yeah.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I start teaching at 6:30am.

The coffee in my thermos gave me confidence that I would be able to string sentences together in front of my clients. And I told myself that sleeping as late as possible was the only sane thing to do, because getting up before 7am is just cruel so you should mitigate that shit as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But during this year a funny thing happened.

        "raw_content": "Part 1Hi team, Coach Hannah here.I need to come clean with you about something: I am NOT a morning person.A year ago, if you had told me that I would willingly get up at 5:30am Monday through Friday I would have laughed you out of the room.And yet.I do. (Im putting the finishing touches on this email at 6:18 am)How the hell did I become a \"morning person\" ???I did not start out this way, kiddos. For those who know me, you know I love to sleep. I do best with 8+ hours per night, every night. So Im not making mornings happen by sacrificing sleep. Mama dont play that sleep dep game. Im hilarious when sleep deprived, but otherwise non-functional and I quickly get overwhelmed and think that the world is terrible and everything is wrong and it will never get better so lets just eat M&Ms and potato chips until we die.Yeah.I start teaching at 6:30am. That means I need to be a) Alert b) Articulate and C) Charming AF by 6:30 in the freaking morning.When this first became the truth of my professional existence, I resisted the early rise kicking and screaming. I would sleep until the LAST possible minute, roll outta bed already wearing workout clothes that Id slept in, make coffee while barely conscious, and then bomb down the road to the gym riding my bike as fast as I could.And it worked. Kinda.The Ill-be-late-if-I-dont-pedal-as-fast-as-humanly-possible bike ride got my heart (and adrenaline) pumping. The coffee in my thermos gave me confidence that I would be able to string sentences together in front of my clients. And I told myself that sleeping as late as possible was the only sane thing to do, because getting up before 7am is just cruel so you should mitigate that shit as much as possible.But during this year a funny thing happened. I began to resent my clients. Even though they were people I loved working with, I noticed my patience getting thinner and thinner. To the point where I was thinking about switching careers.I wasnt happy.Then I heard about this book on a podcast called The Miracle Morning - if that sounds hokey to you, you are right on point.I still cant, in good conscience, recommend the book itselfthe tone of the writing is the worst self-help-salesman-sunshine BS you can imagine. OMG its seriously the worst.But.I was so unhappy that I was willing to try anything, so I ordered the book on amazon, convinced my S.O. to do it with me, and we started our Miracle Morning adventure.Begrudgingly at first, we put the principles outlined in the book into practice.The principles (Which I CAN WHOLEHEARTEDLY recommend, as as follows):Get up an hour earlier than you need toPreset a sequence of actions that will kickstart you into being awake (drink a glass of water, brush your teeth)Do 10 minutes each of 6 practices that are known to improve your happiness, and in turn your life (movement, meditation, journaling, visualization, reading, and affirmation)*Go about your day.*I have since modified WHAT I do in that morning time, as I found that for me personally I feel rushed trying to cram in just 10 mins of each thing, but the habit ofgetting up early and doing something for myself first thing in the morning has stuck.WHY?My work revolves around caring for other people. Being what they need for the hour that we are together. I know many of you can relate to this, even if your line of work is different in name, most of us SERVE OTHERS in our work. Parents really know what Im talking aboutyou take care of tiny humans before you even GO to work. Bless you.The old way I ran my life meant that I was taking care of other people from my first conscious moment until late afternoon. The first time I would do anything purely for myself was 5-6hrs into my day, when I already felt depleted.This new routine flipped the order: I was taking care of MYSELF first thing, before I even thought about another human being.Turns out putting yourself first is a powerful thing.Just a week into implementing this new morning ritual, I felt clear headed. At that point, by body wasnt yet agreeing to the new sleep schedule, which meant I was staying up later than Id like and getting only 6-7hrs of sleep per night.

But sometimes, I like thinking about complex things as simply as possible. Like what to do when your body hurts.*<br><br>Everybody hurts, at some point. Spend enough time doing anything and you'll get hurt doing it, at some point. It is one of the ways our bodies learn, and critical to keeping us safe, because it's the alarm system that let's us know when danger is near.<br><br>But it also creates a lot of strife, and keeps a lot of people from engaging with the world in a physical way. <strong>Becoming fluent in how you communicate with your body means that you are not just terrorized by the alarm, but also tuned in for the good stuff--strength, pleasure, flow--as well.</strong><br><br>In the last couple decades, understanding of pain at the physiological level has led to a huge jump ahead in the world of \"pain science\". Basically, scientists have found lots of evidence that supports the notion of pain as the result of several factors interacting in the brain, resulting in a \"<strong>bio-psycho-social model</strong>\" of pain.*<br><br>Of course, this makes a lot of common sense: what physically happens to our body (bio), AND how we think about it (psycho), AND how others treat us (social) will all effect the actual, physical experience of pain.<br><br>At the same time, with all of those confounding factors, the potential complexity of pain can be overwhelming. Yes, sometimes there is a clear Cause and Effect (like: trip, fall, fracture wrist); but usually it's way, way more complicated. And it's more complicated mostly because how we THINK about our pain, how we manage the mental-game, actually does have a result on our physical experience.<br><br><em>The problem is that most of us are just not that good at managing our minds, especially when it comes to thinking about our bodies.</em><br><br>So, what CAN we do when our bodies hurt? I have a few ideas ;) that I will be sharing over the next few weeks, so stay tuned. You can bet they have to do with <a href=\"https://www.thefitnessalchemists.com/10-minute-morning-alchemy\" target=\"_blank\">CARs</a>, but also meditation, heavy breathing, big-ass kettlebells, and cold showers...<br><br>In the meantime, I'm curious what YOU do when something hurts? When a new pain jumps out at you, or an old pain nags, how do you think about it? How do you manage your pain-experience? How do you help others in pain?<br><br>Seriously, hit me back!<br><br>*I'm not a doctor (and I don't play one on TV), and none of this is medical advice. If you are in pain, you should be already talking to a medical professional. Then come back and read more soothing thoughts on pain science, movement and self-care :).</p>",

Becoming fluent in how you communicate with your body means that you are not just terrorized by the alarm, but also tuned in for the good stuff--strength, pleasure, flow--as well.In the last couple decades, understanding of pain at the physiological level has led to a huge jump ahead in the world of \"pain science\". Basically, scientists have found lots of evidence that supports the notion of pain as the result of several factors interacting in the brain, resulting in a \"bio-psycho-social model\" of pain.*Of course, this makes a lot of common sense: what physically happens to our body (bio), AND how we think about it (psycho), AND how others treat us (social) will all effect the actual, physical experience of pain.At the same time, with all of those confounding factors, the potential complexity of pain can be overwhelming. Yes, sometimes there is a clear Cause and Effect (like: trip, fall, fracture wrist); but usually it's way, way more complicated. And it's more complicated mostly because how we THINK about our pain, how we manage the mental-game, actually does have a result on our physical experience.The problem is that most of us are just not that good at managing our minds, especially when it comes to thinking about our bodies.So, what CAN we do when our bodies hurt? I have a few ideas ;) that I will be sharing over the next few weeks, so stay tuned. You can bet they have to do with CARs, but also meditation, heavy breathing, big-ass kettlebells, and cold showers...In the meantime, I'm curious what YOU do when something hurts? When a new pain jumps out at you, or an old pain nags, how do you think about it? How do you manage your pain-experience? How do you help others in pain?Seriously, hit me back!*I'm not a doctor (and I don't play one on TV), and none of this is medical advice. If you are in pain, you should be already talking to a medical professional. Then come back and read more soothing thoughts on pain science, movement and self-care :).",

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hey, coach Hannah here, with a little confessional story for ya...<br><br>I just got back from a weekend in LA. Last November I signed up for an event I knew barely anything about (you\u2019ve probably heard me talking about the Summit of Power if you <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thefitnessalchemists/\" target=\"_blank\">follow us on Instragram</a>) but when I signed up, it didn\u2019t even have a name yet. This is a different story, for another email.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Leading up to the event, I realized that I would be nearby to one of my mobility training mentors, Hunter Cook. I knew I would kick myself if I didn\u2019t at least <em>try </em>to get in a training session with him while I was in the area. Amazingly, he had an opening in his crazy schedule, so I fought Friday LA traffic to get all the way down to Long Beach.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While we were messaging back and forth before the session, he had asked me to be very clear about what I wanted to address in the session, so that we could jump in and maximize our time together. Here\u2019s exactly what I said:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>\u201cI want to work on my shoulders. They are my personal blind spot. I have a good sense of what my hips (and other joints) need and how to go after it, but I am like a clueless 2 yr old throwing a tantrum when it comes to my shoulders. I'd like to get a clear read on what's needed. I'm hoping that will unlock the same creativity I have so readily at hand when solving for my clients\u2019 issues ;)\"</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To sum up: I\u2019ve always felt like my shoulders were \u201ctight\u201d and lately I\u2019ve been having pain in what used to be my \u201cgood\u201d shoulder. I want to do cool shit like pull-ups and handstands and aerial silks, so I need better range of motion, better control, and no pain.<br><br>If your irony meter is going off the charts right about now, you\u2019re hella tuned in.

        "raw_content": "Hey, coach Hannah here, with a little confessional story for ya...I just got back from a weekend in LA. Last November I signed up for an event I knew barely anything about (youve probably heard me talking about the Summit of Power if you follow us on Instragram) but when I signed up, it didnt even have a name yet. This is a different story, for another email.Leading up to the event, I realized that I would be nearby to one of my mobility training mentors, Hunter Cook. I knew I would kick myself if I didnt at least try to get in a training session with him while I was in the area. Amazingly, he had an opening in his crazy schedule, so I fought Friday LA traffic to get all the way down to Long Beach.While we were messaging back and forth before the session, he had asked me to be very clear about what I wanted to address in the session, so that we could jump in and maximize our time together. Heres exactly what I said:I want to work on my shoulders. They are my personal blind spot. I have a good sense of what my hips (and other joints) need and how to go after it, but I am like a clueless 2 yr old throwing a tantrum when it comes to my shoulders. I'd like to get a clear read on what's needed. I'm hoping that will unlock the same creativity I have so readily at hand when solving for my clients issues ;)\"To sum up: Ive always felt like my shoulders were tight and lately Ive been having pain in what used to be my good shoulder. I want to do cool shit like pull-ups and handstands and aerial silks, so I need better range of motion, better control, and no pain.If your irony meter is going off the charts right about now, youre hella tuned in. Yes, this is exactly the same stuff I help my clients with, every day of the week.So why am I still stuck with tight, painful shoulders?Because knowing is not the same as doing.Here's how our session went down:Hunter started by asking me what I had been doing to make my shoulders better. He then asked me to show him my shoulder CARs (which I do daily). He assessed my range of motion, and confirmed just how limited it is. Based on that assessment, and my reported experience, he told me what I need to work on: the deep stuff - the shoulder capsule - not the outer muscles.We then reviewed the techniques that will address and resolve this issue (techniques I learned at the FRC seminar back in April). He did show me a few new/different set ups for those techniques.I posted some of them on Instagram.But here's the crazy thing: he didnt give me a new magical exercise or even a novel idea. He didnt uncover a mysterious underlying cause that I had missed.Hunter didnt tell me anything I didnt already know.The real lesson that seeing him drove home?Knowing is not the same as doing.The body needs regular and consistent stimulus to make a lasting change.Knowing WHAT TO DO to deliver that stimulus wont make your body change.DOING the thing over and over for a sustained period of time willmake the body change.(I just ended three sentences in a row with the word change - and I'm not going to change that.)The moral of this story is:Sometimes you need to pay someone smart to tell you to do shit you know you should be doing.Even if you are a smart person who other people pay to tell them to do shit they know they should be doing.So Im signing off now, to go DO THE THINGS I need to do to make my shoulders better.Thanks for listening,HannahPS.

        "raw_content": "An image from Sam Harris (hes got an excellent guided meditation app that has been a big help for me) has been stuck in my thinking recently: most of us, most of the time, are just flailing around in the windstorm of our thoughts. Pulled every which way, with no real rhyme or reason, we can often feel utterly out of control, even when were trying really hard to be in control. I know this feeling well. That particular brain-pinch when I imagine that through the power of my own willful thoughts I will somehow change my reality. The utterly egotistical stance that somehow my thinky-thinky will take charge and fix it all.Of course, the notion is false, and I have plenty of evidence that shows me that it is. Standing on stage, hearing a wrong note come from my trumpet bell, and thinking about how to fix it (even though its in the past)Setting up for a deadlift, and thinking that I can ensure perfect form (which really, is not even a possibility). Deep in conversation, and thinking about how to persuade or convince the person Im talking to (which makes it more of an argument than a conversation anyway).Looking at my bank account, and thinking about how to save more (If I just). In each scenario, the active thinking part of my brain that I identify so strongly with--it really feels like me--ramps up. Seeking control, it jumps in heroically to fix the situation. And what starts as one little thread of a thought spawns another, and another, and another Pretty soon its a windstorm up in here, and Im lost.Which begs a question: whats the alternative? How do I make changes to my reality, without spinning out of control whenever I try to do it? The answer, as I have come to realize for myself, lies in understanding the distinction between my states and my traits. States, specifically mental states, capture your current experience. How do you feel, in this moment? Whats happening in your head, right now? What feel like your needs and wants, aversions and obstacles, this very second?Traits describe bigger-picture truths: who are you, most of the time? How do you feel, most of the time? What do you do with your time, most of the time? Explored with some remove, traits clearly describe the parts of reality that we want to change. Getting stronger, being a better listener, performing better (in any realm) all point to trait-change: a slow, progressive shift in who you are.In comparison, it seems obvious that what we feel moment by moment (our states) really shouldnt dictate the kinds of changes we want to make. Its just common sense that the random windstorm (shitstorm?) inside our heads shouldnt be the decider of our life trajectory, right?And yet, so often, it is. The sensations of our consciousness--the thoughts, feelings, smells, emotions, sounds, etc--are so overwhelming, so real, that they demand priority.

A cycle that, over time, becomes part of who you are: a trait. Altering those traits, on the other hand, is a different game. A longer game, and one that must be able to weather the storm in our heads. More on that next week. Thanks for reading, and have a great weekend! Go find your gold-Coach Will ",

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I (Coach Will) spent my senior year of high school in the woods of northern Michigan. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Coming from the beachy, year-round vacation lifestyle that is Southern California, the harsh reality of <em>seasons</em> nearly knocked me on my ass that year. I\u2019d been cold before, but losing sensation in my gloved fingers in the 5-minute walk from the dining hall to the rehearsal shed? Puhhleaaase. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The student body was a high-strung bunch to begin with (it was an arts high school after-all...think FAME, but surrounded by lakes and trees), but the overwhelming winter, unwieldy teenage hormones, and prodigious amounts of artistic talent-potential (and therefore, <em>expectation</em>) warped us into a seething mass of odd-balls. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No parents, no place to <em>go</em> off-campus, no parties, no avoiding anyone (there were only 500 students total across the 4 grades). It was a place designed to help young adults focus their efforts as completely as possible on the pursuit of their art. And sap their sanity. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">By February, we were white-knuckling our coping mechanisms like life-rafts. We couldn\u2019t even comprehend anything beyond our own, personal survival (as I said--we were a dramatic group of adolescents). </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We binged Netflix, and started gossipy rumors. We had stupid arguments with our roommates, about soy milk and gangster rap. We fell (face-down) in love, and broke each other\u2019s hearts. We felt insomnia as the crushing malady that it can become. We looked ahead to our futures with desperation, seeking relief and deliverance. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And then the sun came out. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">First, in just glimpses, in March. The clouds would part, and the remaining snow would glint, and for a moment I could remember what \u2018solar heat\u2019 meant. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then, in April, the tiny buds on the trees would beckon us outside on Saturday afternoons to begin testing the ground for dry spots where we might lay down, heads on each other\u2019s bellies, &nbsp;close our eyes and let the spring wash our souls. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">By May, the tortures of winter were nearly forgotten. The sheer magnificence of burgeoning green, crammed into every corner of the horizon, settled us, softened us, and reminded us how good things could be. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It was a day in May when my friend, sensing some of that old winter desperation in me (to finish a final paper), grabbed my shoulders and said: \u201cWill. Sometimes, you need to move at the speed of plants.\u201d </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">He was right. As we walked outside, those plants rewarded my deep breaths with smells of richness and renewal. My eyes rested in the leaf-filtered light from young trees and their much older siblings.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And I was able to see myself as part of the world, and not the center of it. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Plants offered a way for me to see life as larger than myself, both more delicate and more powerful. I would do well to learn from the way that plants survived and bloomed at their own, unhurried pace, without concern for what they \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d do. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Each spring, I remember my friend\u2019s reminder. I think back to that frantic, delusional winter, and the relief that spring offered.

Coming from the beachy, year-round vacation lifestyle that is Southern California, the harsh reality of seasons nearly knocked me on my ass that year. Id been cold before, but losing sensation in my gloved fingers in the 5-minute walk from the dining hall to the rehearsal shed? Puhhleaaase. The student body was a high-strung bunch to begin with (it was an arts high school after-all...think FAME, but surrounded by lakes and trees), but the overwhelming winter, unwieldy teenage hormones, and prodigious amounts of artistic talent-potential (and therefore, expectation) warped us into a seething mass of odd-balls. No parents, no place to go off-campus, no parties, no avoiding anyone (there were only 500 students total across the 4 grades). It was a place designed to help young adults focus their efforts as completely as possible on the pursuit of their art. And sap their sanity. By February, we were white-knuckling our coping mechanisms like life-rafts. We couldnt even comprehend anything beyond our own, personal survival (as I said--we were a dramatic group of adolescents). We binged Netflix, and started gossipy rumors. We had stupid arguments with our roommates, about soy milk and gangster rap. We fell (face-down) in love, and broke each others hearts. We felt insomnia as the crushing malady that it can become. We looked ahead to our futures with desperation, seeking relief and deliverance. And then the sun came out. First, in just glimpses, in March. The clouds would part, and the remaining snow would glint, and for a moment I could remember what solar heat meant. Then, in April, the tiny buds on the trees would beckon us outside on Saturday afternoons to begin testing the ground for dry spots where we might lay down, heads on each others bellies, close our eyes and let the spring wash our souls. By May, the tortures of winter were nearly forgotten. The sheer magnificence of burgeoning green, crammed into every corner of the horizon, settled us, softened us, and reminded us how good things could be. It was a day in May when my friend, sensing some of that old winter desperation in me (to finish a final paper), grabbed my shoulders and said: Will. Sometimes, you need to move at the speed of plants. He was right. As we walked outside, those plants rewarded my deep breaths with smells of richness and renewal. My eyes rested in the leaf-filtered light from young trees and their much older siblings.And I was able to see myself as part of the world, and not the center of it. Plants offered a way for me to see life as larger than myself, both more delicate and more powerful. I would do well to learn from the way that plants survived and bloomed at their own, unhurried pace, without concern for what they should or shouldnt do. Each spring, I remember my friends reminder. I think back to that frantic, delusional winter, and the relief that spring offered. And as I sow seeds in my small raised beds this year, I cheer all the varied life-forms (plants, people, and all the rest) that are using the sun and making a statement. Happy Spring!- Coach Will",

        "raw_content": "Like many of us, my greatest strength is also a pain-in-the-ass weakness. (Coach Will here.)I tend to over-extrapolate.Over-generalize. Over-connect. Try to draw big lessons from minor blips. Also: look for a meaningful signal amidst all the noise.When its acting as a strength, this tendency helps me see the forest made up of so many trees. It helps me hypothesize about causes, so I might test them out, and it generates intentional strategies that guide my action. I see the chess-board 5 moves ahead.But as a weakness, this kind of connection/implication overdrive has me drawing conclusions from nothing, really. A small comment or minor observation will convince me of things that, no matter how exciting or important-feeling, are just not true.I get so excited--so enthusiastic--to connect ideas and meanings that I readily suspend my disbelief and build all kinds of phantasmagorical notions. When it works, I can see what is not obvious; but when it doesnt, I find myself a mile down a road that doesnt matter, going nowhere.This dynamic is part of me, the good and the bad. For every chess trophy it helped me win as a kid, it has kept me up a dozen sleepless night, spinning insomniac anxiety-fantasies in my head.But only recently have I begun to see the real issue with this powerful skill: having this kind of lens on the world ignores so much.Continuously zooming out means that I miss some important details, even as I get hung up on meaningless ones. And no matter how effective I get at discerning the difference, jumping from conclusion to conclusion denies maybe the best part of life: feeling grateful.Which leads me to realize  When Im struggling, gratitude is often the answer for me.And only recently have I realized that true gratitude is a vulnerable feeling for me, because it means returning to a mind-set from childhood: unadulterated joy, that spontaneous, creative and not-intended-to-be-shared gladness for life.Its an inside feeling, an intimate feeling. And one that changes when it is for others.Its a feeling that has you seeing the world with caring detail, and being generous with your attention to whats really going on. In these moments Im reminded, with relief, that Right now is enough.Ahh, sigh.Long, steady exercise puts me right there.          Which is how I found myself half-way up Mt. Tam last month, astride my bicycle, laughing at how outrageous the tiny wild-flowers were, growing right out the side of the rock face, shaking furiously in the wind and telling the fog to f*ck off with their bright whites and purples and yellows.A voice inside shouted: Will, wait! Capture this moment! Share with all the people who might need a reminder of beauty in the world!This voice came from the zoom-out instinct. The Extrapolator. Tie in everything with everything!But then another voice answered: Right now is enough. Take it in, fully. Make a memory. Cherish it. Let it make your life a little better. Share if you care to, later.And before I knew it, I was 100 feet up the road, too slow with my camera but steady with my gaze.Grateful for sweat and redwoods, water and almonds, for the biting cold and the blue sky peaking just over the ridge.This is how Im untying my own knots, these days. How Im doing my work.Because amidst all the stress and strain, whatever that looks like for each of us, there are corners in our lives where the magic-dust collects. It hides in the crevices, in the nooks where we dont think to look.We must pan for that gold.Have a great week!         -  Coach Will",

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Coach Will here, welcoming you to your Wednesday!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And I need to talk about why movement, fitness, (cue the voice of your worst PE coach memory) \u201cexercise\u201d is--after all is said and done--<em>pure magic</em> to me.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">See, with the movement-DNA link <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/well/move/to-move-is-to-thrive-its-in-our-genes.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FDNA%20(Deoxyribonucleic%20Acid)&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=science&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">recently in the news</span></a> <strong>again</strong>, I found myself navel-gazing <strong>again</strong>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That DNA is incredible \u2018innit*? Basically a tiny folded up building manual for your whole being, reproduced (almost) perfectly in every single one of your cells. For your whole life.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Look at your arm for a moment. Notice the layers apparent to you. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">See your arm hair, and how it rises out of your skin. Notice any visible freckles, or spots, or veins. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And realize that beyond what you can see, you can <strong>feel</strong> much more--heat, pressure, stiffness, ache, firmness/softness of the various tissue. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But now squeeze your fist. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Notice how the tissue jolts into incredible, controlled action. Bones remain sturdy while layers of muscle and sinew slide seamlessly along each other, stretching skin in barely-detectable spirals of tension. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">From a single, simple thought (\u201csqueeze fist\u201d), a coherent response (movement) seems to spontaneously <em>emerge</em>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That dense tangle of tissue, so coherently but unconsciously organized, was <em>written by our DNA</em>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But there\u2019s more. Like the NYTimes reported--but many others (actual coaches/teachers) have been talking about for a long time**--the intent to move, and therefore our reliance <em>on</em> movement, are also written into our DNA. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Finally, combine this with the old, trusty standby of any strength coach worth their iron--<strong>the SAID principle</strong> (which says that a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">S</span>pecific <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">A</span>daptation is the result of the specific <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I</span>mposed <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">D</span>emand--<span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">SAID</span>)--and you have a breathtaking feedback loop. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">An organic algorithm. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The combination of (1.) resilient, change-able tissue, (2.) a drive to move that tissue, and (3.) an observed principle that describes how movement changes that tissue creates a poised and balanced system: <strong>our body</strong>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So the DNA recipe said something like this: Produce cells. Organize according to some basic rules. Start moving. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>And that\u2019s all</strong>, because the recipe could then assume that the <em>moving</em> does the magic of form-fitting us to our lives.

        "raw_content": "Coach Will here, welcoming you to your Wednesday!And I need to talk about why movement, fitness, (cue the voice of your worst PE coach memory) exercise is--after all is said and done--pure magic to me.See, with the movement-DNA link recently in the news again, I found myself navel-gazing again. That DNA is incredible innit*? Basically a tiny folded up building manual for your whole being, reproduced (almost) perfectly in every single one of your cells. For your whole life.Look at your arm for a moment. Notice the layers apparent to you. See your arm hair, and how it rises out of your skin. Notice any visible freckles, or spots, or veins. And realize that beyond what you can see, you can feel much more--heat, pressure, stiffness, ache, firmness/softness of the various tissue. But now squeeze your fist. Notice how the tissue jolts into incredible, controlled action. Bones remain sturdy while layers of muscle and sinew slide seamlessly along each other, stretching skin in barely-detectable spirals of tension. From a single, simple thought (squeeze fist), a coherent response (movement) seems to spontaneously emerge. That dense tangle of tissue, so coherently but unconsciously organized, was written by our DNA. But theres more. Like the NYTimes reported--but many others (actual coaches/teachers) have been talking about for a long time**--the intent to move, and therefore our reliance on movement, are also written into our DNA. Finally, combine this with the old, trusty standby of any strength coach worth their iron--the SAID principle (which says that a Specific Adaptation is the result of the specific Imposed Demand--SAID)--and you have a breathtaking feedback loop. An organic algorithm. The combination of (1.) resilient, change-able tissue, (2.) a drive to move that tissue, and (3.) an observed principle that describes how movement changes that tissue creates a poised and balanced system: our body. So the DNA recipe said something like this: Produce cells. Organize according to some basic rules. Start moving. And thats all, because the recipe could then assume that the moving does the magic of form-fitting us to our lives. Movement literally forms tissue into a specific use-purpose, based on the specific demands of that movement. After all, Force is the language of our cells.***But without movement, we are left with a bunch of tissue that is missing some major guidance as to what it should become. Sure, elbow tissue is the stuff that grows from your elbow; but it only know how to be a part of your arm (and your life) if you teach it, inform it, apply force through it, which is all just to say: use it. So look at your arm again. Look at it with an internal lens, combining your visual, sensational, and imaginary capacities to form a mental model of all the layers, and all the dimensions of scale (muscle, fiber, cell, nucleus, proteins, atoms). Observe your DNA. And realize that you can, and do, talk to it the very moment you begin to move.What do you want to say?To your gold,Coach Will*Also, an incredible, powerful piece of pop-artwork**Dre Spina (FRC), Katy Bowman (Move Your DNA), Kathy Sierra (Intrinzen), Dan John, Paval Tsatsouline (StrongFirst), and a million more etc. etc.***MORE Dre Spina :).",

First, a lack-of-movement pandemic has quite suddenly (in the grand scheme of time) taken hold of huge number of us humans. Our lives, centered around a healthy baseline of physical activity (aka mechanical inputs) even just 50-100 years ago, increasingly demand nothing more physical from us than staring at a screen, typing on a keyboard, and pushing down a gas pedal. This means that all of our joints are literally starved of the mechanical inputs so necessary for normal tissue regulation and maintenance, not to mention building that invaluable brain-map that we will call on when we do start moving. Which brings us to a second major obstacle: the movement options (workouts) that the fitness industry currently provides as stand-ins for these necessary inputs are usually not suited for the development of functional joints.

More often than not, it takes us seeing them as reliable in many small instances over a long period of time, before we truly believe that they are a safe person we can fully trust.This is the same process we need to go through to rebuild trust with our bodies after an injury or pain experience.If your upper traps have been in pain on and off for months, treating yourself to one amazing massage to relax those muscles isnt going to change their trust in you as their caregiver. That is the equivalent of your lover buying you an overly large & expensive bouquet of flowers to make amends for breaking your heart.

        "raw_content": "Bonjour, cest Coach Will, with major news (read on), and waxing poetic...Time, as they say, only moves in one direction.Always forward, onward, into entropy.Into disarray, chaotic apartness.Our only hedge against this overwhelming direction is to organize our Space, to give ourselves the field of awareness in which we might happily enjoy that inscrutable, non-negotiable dissolution into chaos that is Time.This language of physics is studied and pursued precisely because it can sufficiently describe the actions of physical objects large (universe/galaxy/Big Bang) and small (quarks/neutrons/Higgs bosons), as well as all the sizes of things in between.Which is why it is so important that we understand how the laws of physics interact with our own bodies, at the perfectly life-size scale of Us.How does Space manifest in the corners of our bodies? Is there enough Space (for movement and dreaming and loving and striving)? Can your brain feel (articulate) the edges of that Space?These are physical questions about your body that inevitably lead you to focus time and training on your joints--your fulcrums of movement and awareness--themselves governed as much by the laws of physics as by the laws of biology, psychology, neurology, physiology, and all the other, you know, actual science (!!!).But how about space on other scales? How do you feel in terms of consciousness space? Do you have room to mentally maneuver? How about the space inside your guts? Are things happily gliding, or painfully cramped? Relationally? Professionally?In any given situation where Time is a component (e.g. Life), having adequate space is essential for harmonious equilibrium. Its not even just a matter of amount of space. Its a Goldilocks problem: not too much (cant control well), not too little (no room to move!)--just the right amount.Which is why we are so excited to announce that we have secured a lease for our own, dedicated facility--The Fitness Alchemists HQ ;)--in the Lower Dimond neighborhood of Oakland.Of course, many more details to come, but for now we are over the moon to find out what things look like given the adequate room to maneuver.In the game of life, having the right space makes all the difference.

        "raw_content": "I burst into tears on my way to work 3 days ago.It was just after 6am, and I (coach Hannah) was at the stop light at MacArthur & Harrison.While waiting for the light to change, my mind started running through the inventory of people who have offered to help us with the new studio. Some of these offers have already been accepted and played through, others are still waiting in the wings.All of a sudden, as I ran down my mental list of all of the humans who want our business to succeed -- who want us to make the thing that matters the most to us -- I felt overwhelmed with gratitude and tears rolled down my freshly washed, barely awake face.I was so scared to take this step.6 months ago, Will and I talked about it over lunch. Part of me knew it was the right thing to do, but I just felt nauseous and unworthy.A few months later, Will picked me up to go see our first retail listing. He looked over at me, his excitement palpable in the air, and said How ya feeling, Han?Terrified. I said flatly. I wish I could say I felt differently, but thats where Im at.I cant tell yall how grateful I am for Will. He steadfastly kept us putting one foot in front of the other on this new-home search. I could not have done it without him.And now, here we are!Lease signed, construction in progress, designs flooding in, equipment on order, and I finally feel excited. Ready. And so pumped to offer OUR version of fitness alchemy to the world.In that spirit, I wanted to send out a little more info about the new space!We will be located on the corner of Fruitvale Ave & School Street, in the Dimond neighborhood. Its right off the Fruitvale exit on the 580, and YES THERE IS PARKING. Free street parking for blocks and blocks. Not to mention a free park & ride city lot a few blocks away.We removed the old flooring:          And made some new doorways to help folks flow from the entry way into the changing rooms, and back to the bathroom, all without having to set foot on the training floor.          We have had the pleasure of working with some amazing carpenters, who are helping us bring our pipe dream of a wood feature wall that has the function of stall bars to life.

        "raw_content": "Birthdays are always a little weird for me. (coach Hannah, here, writing to you on my actual day of birth.)I was an only child of a single mother, so ALONE was the default for me. I spent more time by myself than I wanted to, and as a result, constantly craved company.Its only in the last year (2019) that I have come full circle on alone time. These days, I really like being alone. I see it as a chance to connect with myself, to fill my cup.I no longer see it as a yawning chasm that I desperately need to fill with company. I actually feel hungry for alone time when I dont get enough.This is a new jam, for me yall!Growing up, birthdays were a big deal in my house. My mom would encourage me to plan elaborate theme parties--whatever my little heart could dream up. But the parties were always a bit of a let-down.The experience never lived up to the anticipated fantasy.Ive finally squared with the fact that piling ALL THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE into one venue for a few hours is actually a bad idea. Its stressful. And it doesnt allow me to connect with each person in the deep and intimate way that makes our relationship sing.So now I embrace the concept of a birthday month and I make lots of celebratory moments with smaller groups of curated people.This year, I also made a playlist, in case you want to dance with me during my birthday month.How do you celebrate yourself? Whats your ideal scenario?I invite you to inquire into this subject, and see if what you *think* you want (aka what you usually do) is really what your truest self is really craving.Love,HannahP.s. this might be the best birthday present this year:          ",

It begins with a tiny imaginative exercise, so if you would indulge me, please close your eyes and...Take a moment to conjure up the physical memory of the last time you felt the sting of being excluded from something you really wanted to be part of.Maybe you'll have to reach back to middle school - and remember not being invited to sit at the cool kids table.

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"> I\u2019m curious, do you work as part of a team? <em>(Coach Hannah, here, with a Friday treat for ya)</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">What happens when you are working towards a deadline, and one of your team members flakes out?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As the saying goes, <em>the show must go on</em>, so usually what happens is the remaining team members are forced to adapt and get the job done <em>somehow</em>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>This is the same thing that happens with the human body.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Think of your joints as members of a team, each with a different specialty and function. The team works most efficiently when each player is doing their own job \u2014 expressing their unique role flawlessly.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Of course the team <em>can</em> pull together and accomplish the goal when one (or more) players are out of commission, and the end result (The product) might appear (to the untrained eye) to be the same as if all players where participating, but the cost is higher to the players who actually pull off the job. There\u2019s added stress. There\u2019s resentment.

        "raw_content": " Im curious, do you work as part of a team? (Coach Hannah, here, with a Friday treat for ya)What happens when you are working towards a deadline, and one of your team members flakes out?As the saying goes, the show must go on, so usually what happens is the remaining team members are forced to adapt and get the job done somehow.This is the same thing that happens with the human body.Think of your joints as members of a team, each with a different specialty and function. The team works most efficiently when each player is doing their own job  expressing their unique role flawlessly.Of course the team can pull together and accomplish the goal when one (or more) players are out of commission, and the end result (The product) might appear (to the untrained eye) to be the same as if all players where participating, but the cost is higher to the players who actually pull off the job. Theres added stress. Theres resentment. Theres burnout.In the case of the human body, if your hip doesnt currently have the capacity that a human hip should, the rest of your joints will find a way to accomplish the job (be it running, doing crossfit, taking yoga, or just walking around and sitting at your desk).However, there will be a higher cost to the rest of your body, and eventually, someone will burn out.The daily practice that I am about to teach you in this video is a way to maintain the health of each joint (each individual player) so that they can continue to function to the best of their individual ability.It needs to be a daily practice in the same way that your teeth need to be brushed daily for optimal oral hygiene.Your joints (every single one of them) need to be taken through their full, pain-free, range of motion every day, in order to clear any plaque build up, and more importantly to deliver nutrition to the deep tissues of the joint itself.You see, muscles have veins and capillaries running through them, which means as long as your heart is pumping, they are getting fed. But your connective tissue (ligaments, tendons, spinal discs, meniscus, etc) do not have this same vascularity, so the ONLY way they get fed is through movement.Any kind of movement will help, but the rotational movements we share in this video deliver the most nutritious meal. Mmm-mm, tasty!Hopefully Ive whetted your appetite.Heres the video -- it will take only 15 minutes of your day, and will deliver exponential results with far-reaching benefits to your physical health.Feel free to share the love by forwarding this email to someone who needs it!To your teams resilience,Hannah",

Even when you rationally know that moving your body is good for you--and will make you feel good--getting started can still be an imposing obstacle.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Motivation--specifically, helping people summon the Get-Up-And-Go--is our white whale, our holy grail. It\u2019s the thing we think continuously about, and yet it\u2019s still the part of building a regular training habit that is <strong>most</strong> challenging for our students. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you\u2019re curious to read my deeper thoughts on the topic, click here for the full article. If you wanna get straight to the actionable tips, read on!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When I stop to really drill into this question of the \u201cbest\u201d way to get people moving, I run into a pile of big obstacles.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">First--motivation means different things for different people. The popular notion, the one summarized in countless Nike ads, often involves early mornings, \u201cbrutal\u201d workouts, aggro trainers yelling at you to dig deep, and a virtuous glow after all is said and done.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This kind of fits-po (fitness inspiration) makes my skin crawl.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Beyond the fact that no one who has ever coached anyone successfully for very long <em>yells</em> at their athletes (coaching is built on trust, and trust is not borne of yelling), the subtle virtue-signaling inherent in these narratives can wreck havoc on our self-esteem and can, if it goes unchecked, totally undermine our ability to exert any sort of control on the direction of our lives.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Further, if we buy into the ads, we believe the idea that there is moral virtue at stake when we do (or don\u2019t) exercise. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This significantly raises the pressure on our decision. After all (according to the ad), our worth as a human, our health, our attractiveness to others can all be decided by our ability or inability to motivate on any given day. This kind of thinking can make the pit of self-hate just too deep to climb out of if/when we fail (because all of us <em>will</em> fail to motivate at some point).</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is definitely another reflection of the insidious way diet culture convinces us that <em>feeling shitty about ourselves is our own fault</em>, which it is not. Always remember: <strong>it is possible to be happy, healthy and fulfilled at any body size and any level of activity, and your worth as a human is not tied into how strictly you stick with an exercise program, diet, or anything else.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And as I mentioned, this cloud of shame can completely undermine our best intentions for ourselves, so getting out from under the oppressive pressures of diet culture <em>must</em> be part of the journey toward having a kick-ass relationship with your body, including the movement of your body.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Which brings us back to the confounding question of getting yourself to <strong>do the thing</strong>, even when you're doing it on YOUR terms. As someone who has \u201cmotivated\u201d to practice music <em>and</em> exercise almost daily for 20+ years, the very experience of <em>being motivated</em> does not (and <em>should</em> not) always require digging deep.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In fact, I\u2019d say that most of the time (all the time?), motivation feels more like adding that last penny that tips the decision-making scales in favor of <strong>doing the thing</strong>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u201cMotivation\u201d really comes down to a choice that you make many minutes or even hours <em>before</em> you do the thing that really takes motivating. Let me give an example:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You are lying in bed, trying to \u201cmotivate\u201d to get up and do your workout. You\u2019ve noticed your day goes much better if you can get some movement in early, so you rationally <em>want</em> to do the workout, but you also feel a great resistance.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Imagine the decision-making scale in your head (think Greek goddess Athena\u2019s scale--not a weight scale), with the not-totally-understood resistance to doing sits on one side, and your more conscious desire to <strong>get it done</strong> sits on the other.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In those quiet moments right after waking, when you still have time to <strong>do the thing</strong>, this scale can feel stuck, balanced right in the middle. But you also know that if you don\u2019t get up soon, your window of opportunity will close and the scales will tip towards inaction.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It\u2019s <em>this </em>moment that could benefit from \u201cmotivation\u201d. That\u2019s because, while it might seem like the decision is momentous--remember, your very <em>worth</em> as a human can get tied up in this--a small push in either direction and the choice is effectively made.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So the question that I encourage you to explore relates to <em>this</em> moment: <strong>what tiny action can you take that will tip the scales for you?</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If, lying in bed, you can decide to put on your favorite sweats and take a big sip of water, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to get up and make coffee, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to <em>just </em>commit to some neck CAR, and that smaller task feels <em>easier</em>, you have tipped the scales.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This works because we all rely on previous action to make sense of the next action. Our brains rely on established patterns, or scripts, to follow in getting us from Point A to Point Z; jumping all the in-between steps is too hard.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">From any of those tiny decisions you make upon waking, the next action flows <em>a little</em> more easily, then the next, and pretty soon you find yourself <strong>doing the thing</strong>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So today, I have <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">3 tiny tips</span> for you to try that can make a gigantic difference in tipping the scales in your favor. All of them can be adapted to <em>your situation</em>, and you can implement them immediately.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Shrink the ask</strong>: just commit to doing the first 5 minutes of the work out/class/whatever. Tell yourself that after the first 5 minutes, if you\u2019re still not feeling it, it\u2019s <strong>totally ok </strong>to decide that today is not your day. That said, at the end of that first 5-minutes, if you feel <em>good</em>, try 5 more minutes, then check-in again. Alternatively, you can just commit to trying a single exercise, and only moving on if you are feeling good <em>at that point</em>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Stay in this moment</strong>: another landmine is to see the day\u2019s workout as representative of all workouts, or even your worth as a person; maybe you think that if you can\u2019t do it today then all your previous work goes out the window (wrong), and/or you\u2019ll never have the heart to do future workouts if you \u201close your momentum\u201d (also wrong). <em>Just focus on today, right now, and see how those first 5 minutes feel.</em>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Bring the challenge closer</strong>: in that moment, when you are trying to summon the will-power (or whatever) to do the thing, try to feel out the ways you could imagine actually enjoying the workout. Put on a favorite t-shirt, make yourself a nice glass of iced lemon water, and (most important) put on some excellent music. The research is pretty clear on this last one: music can both elevate your mood AND lower the perceived intensity of a workout. Give yourself a leg-up, and bump the tunes!</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Have you tried any of these things before? It\u2019s truly amazing how well these small mindset shifts can help.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As you consider how you might implement these things, I\u2019ll leave you with one more thought to ponder: <strong>Action always precedes \u201cmotivation\u201d.</strong> If you can rouse the energy to do the first (tiny) step, it\u2019s amazing how your body and mind switch into doing mode.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Pretty soon, you\u2019re not feeling dead-set against working out, but you\u2019re actually (gasp!) enjoying it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Go be your own hero,&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Coach Will</p>",

The popular notion, the one summarized in countless Nike ads, often involves early mornings, brutal workouts, aggro trainers yelling at you to dig deep, and a virtuous glow after all is said and done.This kind of fits-po (fitness inspiration) makes my skin crawl.Beyond the fact that no one who has ever coached anyone successfully for very long yells at their athletes (coaching is built on trust, and trust is not borne of yelling), the subtle virtue-signaling inherent in these narratives can wreck havoc on our self-esteem and can, if it goes unchecked, totally undermine our ability to exert any sort of control on the direction of our lives.Further, if we buy into the ads, we believe the idea that there is moral virtue at stake when we do (or dont) exercise. This significantly raises the pressure on our decision. After all (according to the ad), our worth as a human, our health, our attractiveness to others can all be decided by our ability or inability to motivate on any given day. This kind of thinking can make the pit of self-hate just too deep to climb out of if/when we fail (because all of us will fail to motivate at some point).This is definitely another reflection of the insidious way diet culture convinces us that feeling shitty about ourselves is our own fault, which it is not. Always remember: it is possible to be happy, healthy and fulfilled at any body size and any level of activity, and your worth as a human is not tied into how strictly you stick with an exercise program, diet, or anything else.And as I mentioned, this cloud of shame can completely undermine our best intentions for ourselves, so getting out from under the oppressive pressures of diet culture must be part of the journey toward having a kick-ass relationship with your body, including the movement of your body.Which brings us back to the confounding question of getting yourself to do the thing, even when you're doing it on YOUR terms. As someone who has motivated to practice music and exercise almost daily for 20+ years, the very experience of being motivated does not (and should not) always require digging deep.In fact, Id say that most of the time (all the time?), motivation feels more like adding that last penny that tips the decision-making scales in favor of doing the thing.Motivation really comes down to a choice that you make many minutes or even hours before you do the thing that really takes motivating. Let me give an example:You are lying in bed, trying to motivate to get up and do your workout. Youve noticed your day goes much better if you can get some movement in early, so you rationally want to do the workout, but you also feel a great resistance.Imagine the decision-making scale in your head (think Greek goddess Athenas scale--not a weight scale), with the not-totally-understood resistance to doing sits on one side, and your more conscious desire to get it done sits on the other.In those quiet moments right after waking, when you still have time to do the thing, this scale can feel stuck, balanced right in the middle. But you also know that if you dont get up soon, your window of opportunity will close and the scales will tip towards inaction.Its this moment that could benefit from motivation. Thats because, while it might seem like the decision is momentous--remember, your very worth as a human can get tied up in this--a small push in either direction and the choice is effectively made.So the question that I encourage you to explore relates to this moment: what tiny action can you take that will tip the scales for you?If, lying in bed, you can decide to put on your favorite sweats and take a big sip of water, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to get up and make coffee, you have tipped the scales. If you can decide to just commit to some neck CAR, and that smaller task feels easier, you have tipped the scales.This works because we all rely on previous action to make sense of the next action. Our brains rely on established patterns, or scripts, to follow in getting us from Point A to Point Z; jumping all the in-between steps is too hard.From any of those tiny decisions you make upon waking, the next action flows a little more easily, then the next, and pretty soon you find yourself doing the thing.So today, I have 3 tiny tips for you to try that can make a gigantic difference in tipping the scales in your favor. All of them can be adapted to your situation, and you can implement them immediately.Shrink the ask: just commit to doing the first 5 minutes of the work out/class/whatever. Tell yourself that after the first 5 minutes, if youre still not feeling it, its totally ok to decide that today is not your day. That said, at the end of that first 5-minutes, if you feel good, try 5 more minutes, then check-in again. Alternatively, you can just commit to trying a single exercise, and only moving on if you are feeling good at that point.Stay in this moment: another landmine is to see the days workout as representative of all workouts, or even your worth as a person; maybe you think that if you cant do it today then all your previous work goes out the window (wrong), and/or youll never have the heart to do future workouts if you lose your momentum (also wrong). Just focus on today, right now, and see how those first 5 minutes feel.Bring the challenge closer: in that moment, when you are trying to summon the will-power (or whatever) to do the thing, try to feel out the ways you could imagine actually enjoying the workout. Put on a favorite t-shirt, make yourself a nice glass of iced lemon water, and (most important) put on some excellent music. The research is pretty clear on this last one: music can both elevate your mood AND lower the perceived intensity of a workout. Give yourself a leg-up, and bump the tunes!Have you tried any of these things before? Its truly amazing how well these small mindset shifts can help.As you consider how you might implement these things, Ill leave you with one more thought to ponder: Action always precedes motivation. If you can rouse the energy to do the first (tiny) step, its amazing how your body and mind switch into doing mode.Pretty soon, youre not feeling dead-set against working out, but youre actually (gasp!) enjoying it.Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

        "author": "WB",
        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Heya, and welcome to your weekend....<br><br>Today, I want to share a tool that has had an outsize impact for me (Coach Will): the&nbsp;<strong>Start Over Button</strong>.<br><br>Very simply, this is the mental switch that allows us to \u201cbegin again\u201d, to leave the paralysis, anxiety, turmoil, etc. we might feel behind for the moment, and invite a&nbsp;<em>new</em>&nbsp;experience, unencumbered by all that weight and pressure.<br><br>Before I really understood this mental reset, I figured it was just a little trick that didn\u2019t really change my reality. But it is in fact an age-old tool--familiar to meditators the world over--to circumvent suffering, and the power of this tool compounds with practice.<br><br><strong>Before I dive in, though, I need to acknowledge that this \u2018Start Over\u2019 mindset switch is not always possible, and it would be callous and ignorant for me to pretend that it is</strong>. In fact, it is a significant privilege of mine that I have had the freedom to practice this ability to press reset.<br><br>This is a privilege born of my inherited status, my whiteness, my relative wealth, my male-ness, my youth, my thinness and my non-disability.<br><br>When I take a steady look at myself, I see someone who enjoys many of the things that make life&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;in this society, many of the parts that&nbsp;<em>obscure</em>&nbsp;what society actually is for many, many people. In fact, it obscures what it feels like and what it offers for&nbsp;<em>most people</em>.<br><br>I\u2019m not ignorant to these privileges persay, because I can learn about them, name them, and look for their impact. But my inability to&nbsp;<em>see</em>&nbsp;reality clearly is shaped by the fact that I simply don\u2019t need to confront the obstacles that so many other people do.<br><br>Which brings me back to this special tool that I have been able to hone through my years of spacious privilege:&nbsp;<strong>the Start Over Button</strong>.

        "raw_content": "Heya, and welcome to your weekend....Today, I want to share a tool that has had an outsize impact for me (Coach Will): theStart Over Button.Very simply, this is the mental switch that allows us to begin again, to leave the paralysis, anxiety, turmoil, etc. we might feel behind for the moment, and invite anewexperience, unencumbered by all that weight and pressure.Before I really understood this mental reset, I figured it was just a little trick that didnt really change my reality. But it is in fact an age-old tool--familiar to meditators the world over--to circumvent suffering, and the power of this tool compounds with practice.Before I dive in, though, I need to acknowledge that this Start Over mindset switch is not always possible, and it would be callous and ignorant for me to pretend that it is. In fact, it is a significant privilege of mine that I have had the freedom to practice this ability to press reset.This is a privilege born of my inherited status, my whiteness, my relative wealth, my male-ness, my youth, my thinness and my non-disability.When I take a steady look at myself, I see someone who enjoys many of the things that make lifeeasierin this society, many of the parts thatobscurewhat society actually is for many, many people. In fact, it obscures what it feels like and what it offers formost people.Im not ignorant to these privileges persay, because I can learn about them, name them, and look for their impact. But my inability toseereality clearly is shaped by the fact that I simply dont need to confront the obstacles that so many other people do.Which brings me back to this special tool that I have been able to hone through my years of spacious privilege:the Start Over Button. By allowing a momentary respite from the noise in my head, this reset switch has offered me clarity--something particularly valuable during this historically fucked-up time. And this clarity has helped me see my privilege, my gaps in experience, and what I might be able to do about all of it.I first heard about the Start Over Button from my trumpet professor in college. We used to meet once a week in the tiny practice rooms high up in the decrepit old Boston office buildings that housed my conservatory (I was a music performance major in college).Sitting there, our knees almost touching, Id pour my soul out each week.

He was continuously trying to help me understand myself in a way that I coulduseto change my trajectory. Looking back, I realize that he taught me most about accessing my inner power; the music was a far second.And theStart Over buttonwas one of his favorite tools.Between snippets of my playing, when hed notice me beginning to struggle, hed lean in and say, Ok, nowblue sky it...press that reset button, and hed press an imaginary button right above my knee cap.With that, hed demonstrate what he wanted: hed shake out his shoulders and neck, take a big, easy breath, blink his eyes wide, and settle back into his chair with a pleasant smile. Hed reset.His reset was so powerful, so purely cleansing for him that I, an eager-to-please, ball-of-nerves undergrad, felt the impact by osmosis. Id lose a bit of my tension, stop gripping my experience quite so hard, and settle into the present moment.Those fleeting windows of clarity didnt do much for my playing in college--I never could really bring that kind of ease to my music-making back then; I cared about it all a little too much.But the Start Over button stuck. I found myself using it more and more after college, to stay calm in a domestic spat, while I was waiting in a too-long line, or during a tough work meeting.And the more that I practiced using it, the simpler it got.

If you want to train to make your insides better, focus on improving those components specifically--yourleg stuff,yourshoulder range-of-motion,yourcardiorespiratory system--anddontjust practice skills.This is part of why Im so passionate about changing the fitness narrative. For all that I hear about how little time people have to train, I want to make sure that whatdoes get trainedis going to be impactful and intentional.So now that youre armed with this knowledge, Id encourage you to use this lense on your current training what are you training when you work out? Are you explicitly working on affecting your insides, or are you sweating after external goals? And if you are, why?Go be your own hero,Coach Will",

So when we want to really&nbsp;<em>know</em>&nbsp;something, to approach an&nbsp;<em>understanding</em>&nbsp;of something--especially a complex thing like the&nbsp;<strong>needs of our bodies--</strong>we need to work with and alongside our emotional realities through a consistent (usually daily) practice of some kind. Having that kind of regularity is the only opportunity we have to find that most-valuable ingredient: perspective.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\u201cIf it\u2019s important, do it everyday,\u201d says one of my favorite coach-philosophers, Dan John.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When I finally learned that--really got it into my bones--my personal fitness approach changed in a subtle but profound way.

I\u2019m talking here about small but persistent doses of movement (10-15 min every damn day) that provide an all-important basis for any other physical activity. It\u2019s the slow-drip pressure that, like the water that shaped the Grand Canyon, slowly yields the big changes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On that foundation, I then spend another regular portion of time (20-30min, 4-5x per week) working on the weak points of my mobility. That is, I stretch and contract and&nbsp;<em>learn</em>&nbsp;to control the parts of my body that are not fully fluent; basically, I do Kinstretch. This is a slow process, but a&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>specifically-targeted one that gradually shifts over time, with the actual stretches and exercises I\u2019m using evolving to reflect the most deficit joints. There is nothing random about this investment of training time. With time and effort and--most importantly--on-going awareness of progress (because of the daily CARs), I move through and beyond my mobility issues.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A back tweak will bring specific spinal work into the rotation for a month; a sore elbow will demand a few sets focusing on elbow control. My chronically jacked R hip will request on-going nursing, but will also slowly unlock more and more possibilities for movement as it gains resiliency and range.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Which brings me to the final component of my regular fitness routine: high-intensity practice. This is the part of training that dominated my understanding of \u201cworking-out\u201d since I was 13, when I was training exclusively so I could see a six-pack. At that time (from what I read on the internet&nbsp;) it seemed that lifting weights, at mostly high-intensities, 3-5 times a week,&nbsp;<strong>would make all my dreams come true</strong>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And in some ways, this kind of habit&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a marker of longevity and physical satisfaction in humans: being&nbsp;<em>strong</em>&nbsp;and being&nbsp;<em>well</em>&nbsp;often go hand in hand (as does weakness and being unwell). But the confusing piece, and what threw me for a loop in my teens and early twenties, was that&nbsp;<strong><em>the body you bring</em>&nbsp;to the exercise matters much more than the exercise or program</strong>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That is, the function of each joint (i.e. does it function?), the effectiveness of your cardiovascular system, and your health status (are you diseased, injured, etc?) will be determining factors in if fitness works for you or not.

And if we can learn how tolearn, we are making a potent investment in ourselves that will have an incredible ripple effect over our lifetime.Lower the stakesThe other big piece that helps me when Im hitting a wall is to take some time to investigate if Im coupling myworth as a humanwith mycompetency at [fill in the blank]Thems some high stakes! Its real hard to be playful, curious, and forgiving of clumsiness & outright mistakes when it feels like your intrinsic worth is on the line.Heres a little exercise I use in my journal when I realize these two things are getting tangled.I am a valuable human. I am not great at ______________________I will still be valuable whether or not I get better at __________________Id like to get better at ____________________ because it will enrich my life in the following ways _____________________________Get the right supportHaving the right support from an empathetic coach makes a HUGE difference.Knowing you arent the only one struggling with this is also a big help.Connecting with community and hearing that folks you admire stumble over the same roadblocks helps.Hence why I wanted to write this :)One of the things that I love/hate about Kinstretch is that it involves end-range training. Because muscles are weakest at end range, training there feels like being a bad at it beginner ALL THE TIME.Heres achance to expand your tolerance for discomfort, via our weekly community Kinstretch class:Kinstretch: Hip Internal RotationAnd Im curious:Do you dislike being bad at things?Do you hold yourself to a precipitously high standard?How do you work with the discomfort of being an awkward beginner?Let's talk about it.To our resilience,HannahP.S.

        "author": "WB",
        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Every once in a while, it\u2019s a good idea to have a moment of gratitude for our most abstracted* organ: our humble heart.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">That thing just works and works, valiantly pumping oxygen- and nutrition-infused blood all over our body. It reacts instantaneously to the shifting demands we place on it, and--most of the time--never takes a break.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But seeing it merely as a pump misses some it\u2019s magnificence, and obscures the ways in which it (like&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;the other tissue in our body) is&nbsp;<em>constantly</em>&nbsp;responding to stimuli and adapting accordingly.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>If we make the mistake of seeing our heart (or any other part of our body) as a&nbsp;<em>fixed, unchanging</em>&nbsp;thing, we risk letting it whither slowly into dysfunction while we undermine it\u2019s incredible ability to transform.</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So.&nbsp; While it\u2019s possible to get lost in the incredible minutiae of how our hearts work (trust me--I have, and it\u2019s a deep, dark Google-hole), I\u2019d encourage each and every one of you to read and process what I\u2019m about to describe about your cardiac muscle. I promise it will take about 5 min to read AND you\u2019ll finish knowing what&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;can do to properly honor that heart of yours.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our hearts are responsible for one main job: sending \u2018spent\u2019 blood to the lungs (to get reloaded with oxygen) and then sending that newly oxygenated blood all over our bodies. That double pump that you feel/hear when you check your pulse is each of those separate-but-related jobs happening in quick succession.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But if we zoom in on what needs to occur for blood to get sent around, we\u2019ll see that the heart is actually engaged in a precise dance back and forth that requires both flexibility&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;strength: first, the heart must expand as it fills with blood, and&nbsp;<em>then</em>&nbsp;it contracts to forcefully send that blood wherever it\u2019s headed.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So that means that&nbsp;<em>right after&nbsp;</em>you hear/feel your heartbeat (the blood going out of your heart), your heart is actually&nbsp;<strong>relaxed</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>stretching</em>&nbsp;to take in new blood. Or it should be.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The problem is that&nbsp;<em>that\u2019s&nbsp;</em>the piece of training our hearts that usually gets skipped.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For most people, when they think of \u201cdoing cardio\u201d they think of the hard work that the heart does to actually pump the blood. Which is why they assume that getting your heart to pump faster&nbsp;<em>must&nbsp;</em>be better. Right?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Wrong! When the only way that you train your heart is to get it to beat faster and pump blood&nbsp;<em>out</em>&nbsp;with more force, you skip over the valuable chance to teach your heart to expand fully and fill with more blood.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is why we continuously guide people to do the majority of their cardio training at a more moderate pace (Zone 2, or 60-70% of your Heart Rate Reserve*), so that they can start training both functions of their hearts--the pumping&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the stretching.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This kind of training is not the kind that will leave you gasping and writhing on the floor after only a few minutes. In fact, we often describe the pace you\u2019ll want to find as \u201cconversational\u201d--as in, you should be able to have a breathless conversation with a friend while you do it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But by improving the function of your heart as a muscle that expands&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;contracts, this kind of training&nbsp;<strong>will</strong>&nbsp;set you up for all those more intense levels of output that you might want to train or play with.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now here\u2019s the kicker: Zone 2 training takes&nbsp;<em>time</em>, and there just aren\u2019t any short-cuts. (Remember, a main part of what we\u2019re training is the&nbsp;<em>time</em>&nbsp;that your heart spends in a stretch, while it\u2019s expanding.)</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Which is why any strategies you can find to&nbsp;<strong>help</strong>&nbsp;you hang out in that Zone 2 and actually--gasp!--enjoy it are good-as-gold. So download some great podcasts, pick a beautiful route, and try out a few&nbsp;<em>different</em>&nbsp;movement options (ie jogging, hiking, biking, rowing, etc.... and here\u2019s a hint: go for the ones you enjoy but ALSO the ones that are most convenient).&nbsp;<strong>Basically, do what you can to make it suck as little as possible to start, and the endorphins you find at the end will do the rest.</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I\u2019ll offer just one more strategy\u2026 the most useful thing&nbsp;<em>I\u2019ve found</em>&nbsp;is to build a little community and intrinsic accountability around my training (somehow, my motivation is significantly impacted when&nbsp;<em>other people see it</em>--which probably says something about me&nbsp;).

        "raw_content": "Every once in a while, its a good idea to have a moment of gratitude for our most abstracted* organ: our humble heart.That thing just works and works, valiantly pumping oxygen- and nutrition-infused blood all over our body. It reacts instantaneously to the shifting demands we place on it, and--most of the time--never takes a break.But seeing it merely as a pump misses some its magnificence, and obscures the ways in which it (likeallthe other tissue in our body) isconstantlyresponding to stimuli and adapting accordingly.If we make the mistake of seeing our heart (or any other part of our body) as afixed, unchangingthing, we risk letting it whither slowly into dysfunction while we undermine its incredible ability to transform.So. While its possible to get lost in the incredible minutiae of how our hearts work (trust me--I have, and its a deep, dark Google-hole), Id encourage each and every one of you to read and process what Im about to describe about your cardiac muscle. I promise it will take about 5 min to read AND youll finish knowing whatyoucan do to properly honor that heart of yours.Our hearts are responsible for one main job: sending spent blood to the lungs (to get reloaded with oxygen) and then sending that newly oxygenated blood all over our bodies. That double pump that you feel/hear when you check your pulse is each of those separate-but-related jobs happening in quick succession.But if we zoom in on what needs to occur for blood to get sent around, well see that the heart is actually engaged in a precise dance back and forth that requires both flexibilityandstrength: first, the heart must expand as it fills with blood, andthenit contracts to forcefully send that blood wherever its headed.So that means thatright afteryou hear/feel your heartbeat (the blood going out of your heart), your heart is actuallyrelaxedandstretchingto take in new blood. Or it should be.The problem is thatthatsthe piece of training our hearts that usually gets skipped.For most people, when they think of doing cardio they think of the hard work that the heart does to actually pump the blood. Which is why they assume that getting your heart to pump fastermustbe better. Right?Wrong! When the only way that you train your heart is to get it to beat faster and pump bloodoutwith more force, you skip over the valuable chance to teach your heart to expand fully and fill with more blood.This is why we continuously guide people to do the majority of their cardio training at a more moderate pace (Zone 2, or 60-70% of your Heart Rate Reserve*), so that they can start training both functions of their hearts--the pumpingandthe stretching.This kind of training is not the kind that will leave you gasping and writhing on the floor after only a few minutes. In fact, we often describe the pace youll want to find as conversational--as in, you should be able to have a breathless conversation with a friend while you do it.But by improving the function of your heart as a muscle that expandsandcontracts, this kind of trainingwillset you up for all those more intense levels of output that you might want to train or play with.Now heres the kicker: Zone 2 training takestime, and there just arent any short-cuts. (Remember, a main part of what were training is thetimethat your heart spends in a stretch, while its expanding.)Which is why any strategies you can find tohelpyou hang out in that Zone 2 and actually--gasp!--enjoy it are good-as-gold. So download some great podcasts, pick a beautiful route, and try out a fewdifferentmovement options (ie jogging, hiking, biking, rowing, etc.... and heres a hint: go for the ones you enjoy but ALSO the ones that are most convenient).Basically, do what you can to make it suck as little as possible to start, and the endorphins you find at the end will do the rest.Ill offer just one more strategy the most useful thingIve foundis to build a little community and intrinsic accountability around my training (somehow, my motivation is significantly impacted whenother people see it--which probably says something about me). Considering current shelter-in-place demands, that means we must look online for this too, but luckily weve found just the ticket withStrava.Several of you jumped on board with this app when I first introd it a couple months back, and wed love to have more of you; we even have aTFA groupyou can join once you set up your profile.

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The more I have learned about the human body, the more I am amazed that all of us don\u2019t just crumple and collapse with the slightest breeze. (Coach Will here&nbsp;)<br><br>I don\u2019t get this sense because of how fragile we are--we are&nbsp;<em>clearly</em>&nbsp;not--but because of how interconnected and&nbsp;<em>complex</em>&nbsp;the human body is. So many components that are essential for baseline health depend on so many other components, which themselves are dependent on other components, and so on.<br><br>Each stage is super complex unto itself, little puzzles of biochemistry and cellular communication that need to work&nbsp;<em>juuuusst&nbsp;</em>right. To think that these hundreds of separate phenomenon actually coexist and thrive in sequence is not just implausible, it\u2019s miraculous.<br><br>This chain of dependence means that a process that breaks down anywhere along the line would be catastrophic, and&nbsp;<em>yet that rarely happens</em>. Most of us, most of the time, manage the variations of our lives just fine, and our complex body systems just accept the novelty and carry on.<br><br>So... how do we do it?<br><br>It\u2019s actually this very same complexity that makes us able to handle variations that we run into. Each link in a chain of dependent, interacting steps offers just enough wiggle-room that taken together, all the links actually can manage a large amount of variability.<br><br>OK, ok, I know this is a bit abstract, so how about an example: imagine a human breathing at rest (maybe like you are, now, reading this newsletter!)...&nbsp;<br><br>...air gets pulled into lungs, where it is broken down in a split second so that oxygen can jump on the back of a little red blood cell and go for a quick run to somewhere in the body (through miles of circulatory plumbing) to deliver its oxygen cargo to a cell that needs it (muscle, skin, organ, etc). That oxygen then has to get&nbsp;<em>into</em>&nbsp;the target cell (a complex process itself) before getting consumed as part of a set of&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;complex cycles that use the oxygen, along with energy we get from food (carbs, fats, etc) to make the form of energy that our tissues can use to actually move (ATP).<br><br>Now, don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t be heading any further down&nbsp;<strong>that</strong>&nbsp;biochem rabbit-hole, but I wanted to run through it so you can get a feel for the&nbsp;<em>high-wire balancing act that our bodies execute flawlessly with each and every breath</em>.<br><br>But it get\u2019s crazier. Let\u2019s say you were to stand up from rest, and start running down the street. All of a sudden, your body would be tasked with continuing to handle oxygen&nbsp;<em>but also</em>&nbsp;would activate other (also complex) energy-providing systems to allow for this sudden&nbsp;<strong>variation</strong>, and they would do it almost instantaneously.<br><br>The only way that that huge change in demand (running vs resting) happens is if the job gets broken up into many, many smaller systems. That way, each system is only tasked with a small change within its own sphere of action. Together, these small changes make-up a flexible, resilient response to that new demand of running down the street.<br><br>So when we want to&nbsp;<em>improve these systems</em>--<strong>to fit ourselves more effectively to the whole realm of possible challenges we might face each day or week or year--</strong>one of the best things we can do is to simply&nbsp;<em>check-in</em>&nbsp;on the systems in question.<br><br>That\u2019s right: just&nbsp;<em>use</em>&nbsp;them.<br><br>In the example I walk thru above, that might look like spending some time really using your body\u2019s aerobic (oxygen-using) pathway--like on a brisk walk--as well as it\u2019s anaerobic pathways (eg when you start running fast).<br><br>In the case of another complex system that we rely on each day--your system of joints and tissue--that \u201ccheck-in\u201d might look like a controlled circle through your largest, pain-free range of motion at each joint. This is quite literally a quick inventory of all the various positions that your body might move into, joint by joint.

        "raw_content": "The more I have learned about the human body, the more I am amazed that all of us dont just crumple and collapse with the slightest breeze. (Coach Will here)I dont get this sense because of how fragile we are--we areclearlynot--but because of how interconnected andcomplexthe human body is. So many components that are essential for baseline health depend on so many other components, which themselves are dependent on other components, and so on.Each stage is super complex unto itself, little puzzles of biochemistry and cellular communication that need to workjuuuusstright. To think that these hundreds of separate phenomenon actually coexist and thrive in sequence is not just implausible, its miraculous.This chain of dependence means that a process that breaks down anywhere along the line would be catastrophic, andyet that rarely happens. Most of us, most of the time, manage the variations of our lives just fine, and our complex body systems just accept the novelty and carry on.So... how do we do it?Its actually this very same complexity that makes us able to handle variations that we run into. Each link in a chain of dependent, interacting steps offers just enough wiggle-room that taken together, all the links actually can manage a large amount of variability.OK, ok, I know this is a bit abstract, so how about an example: imagine a human breathing at rest (maybe like you are, now, reading this newsletter!)......air gets pulled into lungs, where it is broken down in a split second so that oxygen can jump on the back of a little red blood cell and go for a quick run to somewhere in the body (through miles of circulatory plumbing) to deliver its oxygen cargo to a cell that needs it (muscle, skin, organ, etc). That oxygen then has to getintothe target cell (a complex process itself) before getting consumed as part of a set ofverycomplex cycles that use the oxygen, along with energy we get from food (carbs, fats, etc) to make the form of energy that our tissues can use to actually move (ATP).Now, dont worry, we wont be heading any further downthatbiochem rabbit-hole, but I wanted to run through it so you can get a feel for thehigh-wire balancing act that our bodies execute flawlessly with each and every breath.But it gets crazier. Lets say you were to stand up from rest, and start running down the street. All of a sudden, your body would be tasked with continuing to handle oxygenbut alsowould activate other (also complex) energy-providing systems to allow for this suddenvariation, and they would do it almost instantaneously.The only way that that huge change in demand (running vs resting) happens is if the job gets broken up into many, many smaller systems. That way, each system is only tasked with a small change within its own sphere of action. Together, these small changes make-up a flexible, resilient response to that new demand of running down the street.So when we want toimprove these systems--to fit ourselves more effectively to the whole realm of possible challenges we might face each day or week or year--one of the best things we can do is to simplycheck-inon the systems in question.Thats right: justusethem.In the example I walk thru above, that might look like spending some time really using your bodys aerobic (oxygen-using) pathway--like on a brisk walk--as well as its anaerobic pathways (eg when you start running fast).In the case of another complex system that we rely on each day--your system of joints and tissue--that check-in might look like a controlled circle through your largest, pain-free range of motion at each joint. This is quite literally a quick inventory of all the various positions that your body might move into, joint by joint. We call them Controlled Articular Rotations (CARs), and they are a powerful addition to any/everyones day (if youre curious,give em a shot!).By simplyusingthe range of motion you have, and doing so often, you are essentially accounting for thewiggle roomthat is your bodys way of dealing with whatever the world throws at you. Remember, its that wiggle room that makes the difference when it comes to handling an unpredictable variation--tripping off a curb, reaching under a table, carrying a heavy box--ornot. Trust me:you want to honor and maintain that wiggle room.No matter what body system youre looking to improve, the place to start is by simply engaging that system andusingyour capabilities.Youll be amazed at the miraculous human solutions youll find at work, hiding right under your noseGo find your gold,Coach Will",

Healthier capsules equals better feedback.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But being engaged in activities that we&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to learn or improve at is not nearly as straight-forward as it might seem.

        "formatted_content": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hey there,</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Well here we are, in the fall of 2020, and what a time it is.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Considering the ridiculous obstacles we\u2019re all facing, I think it\u2019s important to take a moment to send some appreciation to the body that has gotten each of us to this point.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Go ahead, give that body a pat on the back. Hell, give it a hug. You deserve the shit out of it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Ahhh, that\u2019s better. It\u2019s so easy to lose sight of the work that each of our bodies do, behind the scenes, each and every day. But all it takes to unwind that uneven relationship is to spend a little love, and check in with your body like you would with a close friend.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The way that this can shift our attitude (and therefore our approach to training) is part of why I love talking with new folx about their fitness journey and goals.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Especially as a \u201cpersonal trainer\u201d, a title that comes indelibly stamped with that gym-rat stereotype, it can come as a surprise when I begin our conversation with curiosity about how they\u2019re currently taking care of their body.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Not how they are crushing it, or pushing it, but how they are honoring the relation they have to their physical body.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The reality is that each of us do some amount of care for our bodies, every day. We all sleep and eat. We all feel the pull to reach for a delicious stretch in the morning, and many, many of us recognize the boost we can get from a short walk around our neighborhood.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As simple as those pieces seem, they often make up the extent of the ways that we interact with our bodies and its needs.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But the fitness questions really start to come up when folx start considering how to move beyond a base-level of body relations. How can they cajole their body to change in a specific way? And, critically, how can they do it without hurting themselves?</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This exact topic came up in a call last week with a new client.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She mentioned that she hated gyms and gym-culture, and had decided in her early thirties that she did not need to fuck with gyms ever again.

        "raw_content": "Hey there,Well here we are, in the fall of 2020, and what a time it is.Considering the ridiculous obstacles were all facing, I think its important to take a moment to send some appreciation to the body that has gotten each of us to this point.Go ahead, give that body a pat on the back. Hell, give it a hug. You deserve the shit out of it.Ahhh, thats better. Its so easy to lose sight of the work that each of our bodies do, behind the scenes, each and every day. But all it takes to unwind that uneven relationship is to spend a little love, and check in with your body like you would with a close friend.The way that this can shift our attitude (and therefore our approach to training) is part of why I love talking with new folx about their fitness journey and goals.Especially as a personal trainer, a title that comes indelibly stamped with that gym-rat stereotype, it can come as a surprise when I begin our conversation with curiosity about how theyre currently taking care of their body.Not how they are crushing it, or pushing it, but how they are honoring the relation they have to their physical body.The reality is that each of us do some amount of care for our bodies, every day. We all sleep and eat. We all feel the pull to reach for a delicious stretch in the morning, and many, many of us recognize the boost we can get from a short walk around our neighborhood.As simple as those pieces seem, they often make up the extent of the ways that we interact with our bodies and its needs.But the fitness questions really start to come up when folx start considering how to move beyond a base-level of body relations. How can they cajole their body to change in a specific way? And, critically, how can they do it without hurting themselves?This exact topic came up in a call last week with a new client.She mentioned that she hated gyms and gym-culture, and had decided in her early thirties that she did not need to fuck with gyms ever again. Despite my background, I found her directness refreshing, hilarious, and legitimate; mainstream fitness culture has hurt a lot of people, inside and out.But she was still interested in shoring up some areas of her body that regularly cried out in fear and pain, especially whenever she tried to move more in the ways that she loves. Several courses of physical therapy had allayed the acute pain in her ankle and neck, but left the underlying insecurity about if she could actually trust those joints.She then called out how the ways that she saw to work on her body and (potentially) clear up those issues seemed like a big jump. Rather than building her inner sense of security and safety, most fitness options she had tried and researched just plain didnt respect the inner boundaries (what and what didnt feel ok to her physical body) that she had cultivated over years as a yoga teacher.And then she said the thing that connected her with soooo many other clients that weve worked with: There just seems to be this gap between what healthcare can do for me, and what I want my body to do.There surely is a gap between pain mitigation (the work of health care) and realizing our physical dreams, and bridging that gap is our work at the Fitness Alchemists.Whether we are helping build awareness of the gap (between what you can and cannot do safely, right now) or working on steadily spanning the gap (with progressive strength training), our goal is that people find a way back to trusting their physical bodies.Body-trust quickly clears the path for body-confidence, which is the stuff that rich, physical lives are made of.If this gap is something youve grappled with, Id love to hear about it. And if youre curious how we might go about bridging that gap for you, book a call with me...Id love to chat. ;)Go be a hero,Coach Will",

TASTE YOUR BROTH. If it tastes amazing already, you have added enough salt. It it tastes like something is missing but you don't know what, add another half teaspoon of salt and return to boiling. Taste again. Rinse repeat until that broth tastes crazy good.Dont skip this step  this is the KEY to satisfying soup, and will be very unique to the individual. #GoldilocksMomementTurn the heat down to med/low to achieve a lovely simmer, and dump in ginger and lemongrass. Let that ish simmer for AT LEAST 20 mins. The longer you simmer, the deeper the flavor, but we all gotta eat, and a weeknight is a weeknight, so...Use the 20min simmer to prep your other veggies:De-stem and chop or tear kale into bite-size piecesthinly slice carrots ( a mandolin works well here, I used my Cuisinart with the mandolin blade)Remove the seeds, then quarter and thinly slice bell pepperThinly slice mushroomsremove chicken from bones, set aside. Strain the ginger and lemongrass out of the broth (a slotted spoon works well here)Add curry paste and stir to combine/dissolveAdd your most dense veggies first (kale & Carrots) and simmer for 5-7 minutes. Taste a carrot--if it is no longer crunchy, you're good,Add mushrooms and bell peppers, simmer for another 5 minutes.Add coconut milk or creamAdd chicken and simmer 5 mins to warmTop with Cilantro and a lime wedge for extra fancinessSlurp it out of big bowls and feel better almost immediately!          Why do I call this Immunity Soup?Great question. The ingredients are specifically chosen for their nutrient density, and immunity-boosting properties.Red Bell peppers & carrots are a rich source of Vitamin CMushrooms are anti-inflammatory and boost immune response (read thefull report on PubMed)Kale is incredibly nutrient-dense, as well as having\"high antioxidant activity\"Chicken bone broth is a rich source of collagen, which your body breaks down into amino acids (The building blocks of all life) and uses to repair anything that needs it. It is also hydrating, and can help replenish electrolytes.

        "raw_content": "Hey,This mistake is SO OBVIOUS (now that I see it clearly) but is literally the most common thing that everyone overlooks.It's one of those small changesthat has an outsized positive impact on your body, and therefore, your LIFE.Most people, and even mosttrainers, dont invest enough time & energy in getting a clear sense  a felt sense oftheir unique starting point.It takes a regular practice, I would argue a daily practice, dedicated to simply understanding where one is in the present moment, in order to truly have the information needed about where we are beginning.Clearly knowingwhere we are starting fromallows us totake the needed first step in the direction that we wish to go.Ive watched so many clients and loved ones misunderstand where they are starting from, and take the step thatseems likethe first step, only to get feedback from their bodies thatit was actually the 10th step. Oops.This generally knocks them back to square 1, or even square -2,which emotionally feels likesquare -15.So my question to you today is:How much of your dedicated movement practice time during the week are you devoting to asking your body these questions:where am I?what is available in this present moment?I'd love to hear your answer.Before I sign off, I'll shareone more helpful thing:This videois 16mins long, and walks you throughthe exact set of movements we teach our clients to use for daily self-assessment + awareness building.Its free on our YouTube channel.Give it a try.If you have questions about any of the moves, I'd love to talk you through it.Reply here, and I'll get back toyou in a couple of days.To taking the actual 1st step,HannahPSSo...the holidays are here!And that usually means more than usual family/social time and hectic schedules anda drop off of our personal movement practice.Who knows what this will be like during covid...But just in case, we are running a challenge during the2nd half of December to support our members in maintaining their commitment of doing at least 10mins of movement practice every day.Im thinking we could open it up to the general public, without too much hassle on our end.Would you be game for something like that?Lemme know if youd like to do that with us and Ill make sure we invite you when registration opens up.",

I know--weird, right? If they are not interested or curious enough, they will eventually lose any drive to keep going (as an aside, this is why competition is SO powerful: it is supremely interesting--for *some* humans--to test themselves, over and over).This last obstacle in particular helps shed some light on why I can so confidently say that humans are driven toward moving their bodies.Movement is part of how we express our drive for understanding. When babies are born, they reflexively begin moving all of their parts, not in some pre-programmed set-up protocol, but actually just to explore their surroundings. Those surroundings are transmitted to their brain via sensory cells in their eyes, ears, nose, skin and--most significantly for our purposes--in their joints. And that sensory information is translated, over time, into a map of sorts for their brain to follow as that baby finds their place in the world.So when an arm waves, the baby is not just feeling the air with their hands but actually is mapping the physical possibilities for further exploration (If that babies nervous system was providing commentary, it might say something like Ooo, I can move my arm over *here*!)This same link--between curiosity about ourselves, our surroundings, our possibilities, and physical movement--is a central part of life for adults, too.In fact, if movement is really interesting, it will actually obscure the blockages caused by other obstacles (example: if I love playing soccer enough, it will be easier to ignore physical limitations in my ankle or hip).On the other hand, if movement is not interesting, it quickly becomes stale and starts to feel like busy-work--something you have to do, and not something youd like to do. We all know what that feels like.Theres much more to dig into in future newsletters, but Im going to pause there for now, because Im curious.Do you feel these obstacles present in your life? How do they manifest for you?Id love to hear from your nervous systems perspective .To finding your gold, Coach Will*which I can understand! It took us fully 1-2 years of practice and study--after already training for several years--to really implement the kind of training that truly builds mobility.",

It's immediately rewarding and life-enriching. It helps us *feel* our bodies in a positive light.And, for most of us, there are parts of our bodies that are asking for some specific tending....an ankle that complains when we run...a tender low back that doesn't appreciate the high-octane kitchen dance party we got up to last night...wrists that aren't ready to support our bodyweight...a hip that aches after a long daya stiff neck that interrupts our focus when we try to write (oh hey, thats me!)These parts that need tending can change, and they are going to need:- specific inputs, to invite the adaptation that we want- consistent inputs, over enough timeaka patience & devotion.What we have found is that it doesn't work to completely put movement-joy on hold, while we \"fix\" the part(s) that need tending.It takes too long, and we lose sight of what its all for.Connecting with activities that you love -- that bring that joyous sparkle -- help us feel motivated to actually *do* the tending stuff.The Tending, in turn, opens up more avenues for Joy.It's a virtuous cycle.So Im curiousHow are you accessing embodied JOY these days?

And I am a coach & movement professional.Trust me  I sometimes judge myself pretty harshly for not having that get-up-and-go energy every single day.I hear from my clients, and I feel in myself, a yearning to solve the motivation problem for good.Heres the real T: I dont know that this is a realistic desire.The kind of motivation that can stoke a lifetime can't be single-sided or one-size-fits-all. We humans are too variable, and life is too random.That long-haul motivation needs to be something that has polarity to it, so it can flex with us as things shift.I talked about this last week, and I'm gonna keep saying it, cuz I really think we are on to something here.Motivation that is rooted in our own autonomy is a balance between:JOY + TENDINGMovement practices flourish and motivation simmers in variable yet steady supply when these two polarities are present.Joyfulmovement is its own reward  you might need more of this element when you are burnt out, stressed, or just dont have the capacity to focus on one. more. thing.Tendingmovements unlock more possibilities for joyful movement, but they take a bit more focus & specificity. (Often they bring some amount of immediate relief, which can also be rewarding.)How might your movement practice (and motivation to move) shift, if you invited yourself to blend these two elements in the right ratio for you, ON ANY GIVEN DAY?If you allowed yourself to be variable, to show up to practice as you are, and met yourself lovingly with the right mixture of Joy + Tending?Have you had a time in your life when you felt like you were both...Tending to the parts that need more strength, more resilience, more flexibilityand...Joyfully moving your body in ways that felt playful, exploratory, exciting, and/or great for your mental health?It could begin with just 10mins a day of each. Or even 5mins of each. Or 5 and 10. Or 45 and 5. As we always say in our Kinstretch classes, its a variable to play with!If motivation has been a challenge for you, I've love to hear how this concept is landing for you.In your corner,Coach Hannah",

It was as hot and humid that summer, and the only thing going in town was the library, where I stumbled upon the classic, \u2018<a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-art-of-japanese-joinery/9780834815162\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Japanese Joinery</a>\u2019.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The 10yr-old in me flipped, and I fell into a deep and abiding fascination with how something so simple\u2014essentially wooden blocks\u2014could be assembled into everything from tiny, jewel-like boxes to sweeping temple roofs that have stood for 400 years, outlasting many more \u2018modern\u2019 buildings.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I learned about the guilds that had carefully cultivated these secrets.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I learned about the careful forestry and harvesting they did of the trees, so that the eventual structure built from a certain tree would actually become stronger, tighter, as it aged.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But I became most engaged by the tools of the trade.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">See\u2014foregoing modern materials wasn\u2019t the only way Japanese carpenters didn\u2019t conform; they also maintained an almost holy obsession with their simple, mechanical implements of their predecessors: handsaws, chisels, mallets and lines of string for marking straight lines.*</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">One night, as I randomly perused Japanese carpentry articles online, I finally read about what it was like to be a carpentry apprentice.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Here\u2019s how I remember it\u2026</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Apparently, at first, they just have you sweep the floor.

        "raw_content": "There is an incredible carpentry tradition in Japan, founded largely upon creating structures and furniture with jointswhere edges of wood come togetherthat dont use any nails, screws or glue.Instead, they rely on and apply ancestral knowledge regarding the shape of strong connection points, and build incredibly stable structures largely by making very precise cuts, by hand.Now |FNAME|, I wanted to to tell you about this today because it has a deep connection to how we can approach our bodies in a different, and I think better, way than main stream culture would have us do. This is a longer one, but its been brewing for a while sostick with me :).In addition to being as effective, and sometimes *more* effective, as modern Western carpentry methods (using metal and glue), the result is stunningly beautiful.          I was first captivated by this art/craft/culture after college, when I found myself living in a small town on the Western brim of Massachusetts. It was as hot and humid that summer, and the only thing going in town was the library, where I stumbled upon the classic, The Art of Japanese Joinery.The 10yr-old in me flipped, and I fell into a deep and abiding fascination with how something so simpleessentially wooden blockscould be assembled into everything from tiny, jewel-like boxes to sweeping temple roofs that have stood for 400 years, outlasting many more modern buildings.I learned about the guilds that had carefully cultivated these secrets.I learned about the careful forestry and harvesting they did of the trees, so that the eventual structure built from a certain tree would actually become stronger, tighter, as it aged.But I became most engaged by the tools of the trade.Seeforegoing modern materials wasnt the only way Japanese carpenters didnt conform; they also maintained an almost holy obsession with their simple, mechanical implements of their predecessors: handsaws, chisels, mallets and lines of string for marking straight lines.*One night, as I randomly perused Japanese carpentry articles online, I finally read about what it was like to be a carpentry apprentice.Heres how I remember itApparently, at first, they just have you sweep the floor. For about 6 months. Very clean.Then, they begin to teach you about sharpening the saws, some of which are 100+ years old. 100s of saw teeth. Sharp.If youre still there after a couple years of sharpening saws, theyll graduate you up to the planes, and then finally the chisels which do much of the final joint-shaping. Make them Very Sharp.After 5 years, they begin to teach you the way that you cut and shape wood into joints, and then its several more years (like 10+) before becoming a master.The more I learned, the more it became clear that the sharpening of knives was not just a tortuous initiation process to weed out casual hobbyists.No, it functioned as an indoctrination into the essential, fundamental mind-set of a carpenter, and it informed everything they did.After 5 or more years of simply sharpening tools, I imagine that one must come around to appreciating this subtle act.They must form a connection with these precious, inanimate objects, and how to best conjure a sharp, cutting edge.And then, as they learn how to wield them on the precious, natural gift that is a dead tree, these students of the steel realize that all their their dedication to sharpening is now coming back to them in the form of steady cuts and straight edges.Over and over and over, steady cuts and straight edges.No machines are needed when a master craftsman is wielding a sharp blade over a clean, hand-selected board.Now for the analogy to our bodies that I have endlessly pondered since that sweaty Massachusetts summer what is the valiant, daily act that we might do for ourselves that best compares to a carpenter sharpening their blades?What will not just make us sharper, but actually more capable of doing our craft and making our work?What action/s will hone our bodies into the most true version of ourselves, the most effective and joyful version?What beliefs will we need to hold onto, amidst all the bullshit swirling around, and what will we need to ignore?And finally, what attitude will we take to our work, and what will our work inspire us to do next?The underlying connection is that the work of our livesbe it physical work or just, you know, the fact our lives occur inside a PHYSICAL BODYwill always be the result of our ability to use our tools,And the tools of living in a body are our joints. Our knees, and shoulders and all the rest.Thats rightin the world of movement, which is our world, our joints are the fundamental way that we get through. It is how we go toward the things we want, and go away from those we dont.Its how we grow, and how we multiply.Our joints are the carpenters chisel, our saw, that we use to construct the work of our dreams: our lives.This is why I am so adamant about spending the little time that we each day to moveat least some of iton sharpening our joints, on making our movement-parts work a little better.What would you make with joints that cut a straighter path to where you wanted to go?-Coach WillPs: If youre curious about what a Daily Sharpen might look like for you, reply to this email with SHARP in the subject line and lll send you a Kinstretch class to try out. You gotta feel it to believe it*No power saws, no drill presses, and most of the work was done on the ground. I knowWHAT?!",

I love this image because it gets right to the heart of the big question \u2026 <strong>What should <em>I</em> do for fitness?</strong><br><br>And I love <a href=\"https://thefitnessalchemists.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacb2032c625fd65882dd3525&amp;id=ee9199337c&amp;e=77f9642a5a\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">the accompanying post</span></a> because Jon\u2019s implied answer is so expansive (and correct IMO): <strong>\u2026do whatever you <em>want</em>, first and foremost.</strong><br><br>Movement is integral to humans because it literally is the <strong>embodiment of our ability to <em>live</em></strong>, to go after the things we want and to be able to avoid the things that might do us harm.<br><br>So when Jon (or i) say that <strong>the fact that you DO move your body is much, much more important than HOW you move your body</strong> we are basing that on the aspects of each of us humans that are the same, the parts of our experience that overlap across every person (tho of course, not every part of every person...)<br><br>That is, we base it on our essential humanity.<br><br>And this means that the particular <em>way</em> that the innate drive to MOVE shows up in each of our individual modern lives\u2014a time when survival is no longer linked to the movement of our body\u2014is as varied and amazing as our socks, or our cooking, or our dreams.<br><br>So then <em>why</em> do I spend most of my time evangelizing for the practice of \u2018Mobility\u2019 training\u2014which comes with the <em>clear intention</em> of altering HOW you move? (And why oh why does it need such a NON-sexy name?! sigh\u2026)<br><br>The reason lies in this fact \u2026 <strong>all too often, movement <em>doesn\u2019t </em>show up in someone\u2019s life at all.</strong> And when it goes missing, all of the systems in our body that require <em>mechanical</em>\u2014movement\u2014inputs for function (which is\u2026 ALL of them) begin to degrade and break-down.<br><br>As the parts of the system run down, movement stops feeling quite as good. Maybe eventually it actually feels <em>bad </em>(like when we get injured)<em>.</em><br><br>At the heart of WHY movement stops feeling good is because one of the most crucial body components that degrades is <strong>our ability to feel ourselves</strong>.<br><br>...aka, the literal ability to notice sensation.<br><br>When you can\u2019t <strong><em>feel</em></strong> yourself clearly, on a sensation level, your brain is blind to all the possible ways you might find to move.<br><br>And with that blindness, the idea of movement gets less and less bright, exciting, pleasurable, <em>motivating</em>; in contrast, when the brain can \u201c<em>see\u201d</em> all the sensations of your body, it can <em>find</em> the most effective, most fun, \u201cbest\u201d way to move YOUR body.<br><br>So what's the antidote? How do we reverse this negative sensation doom spiral....? <strong><em>We give the body more information, especially at it's edges. </em></strong>Which means, we give the body more experience (moving/working/training) at <strong><em>end range.</em></strong><br><br>By introducing the body to it's 'boundaries' (the full range of motion of all of your joints), your brain now has a ton of useful, actionable information about what's possible to do in the world around it (aka around YOU). <br><br>Over time, and given enough <em>information</em>, your brain will absolutely figure out your particular movement <strong><em>need</em></strong>, your WHAT; <strong>my job is to help your brain get the information it needs</strong> to do this magic.<br><br>If moving and changing your body in this way sounds exciting or interesting I\u2019d love to set up a call with you.

I love this image because it gets right to the heart of the big question  What should I do for fitness?And I love the accompanying post because Jons implied answer is so expansive (and correct IMO): do whatever you want, first and foremost.Movement is integral to humans because it literally is the embodiment of our ability to live, to go after the things we want and to be able to avoid the things that might do us harm.So when Jon (or i) say that the fact that you DO move your body is much, much more important than HOW you move your body we are basing that on the aspects of each of us humans that are the same, the parts of our experience that overlap across every person (tho of course, not every part of every person...)That is, we base it on our essential humanity.And this means that the particular way that the innate drive to MOVE shows up in each of our individual modern livesa time when survival is no longer linked to the movement of our bodyis as varied and amazing as our socks, or our cooking, or our dreams.So then why do I spend most of my time evangelizing for the practice of Mobility trainingwhich comes with the clear intention of altering HOW you move? (And why oh why does it need such a NON-sexy name?! sigh)The reason lies in this fact  all too often, movement doesnt show up in someones life at all. And when it goes missing, all of the systems in our body that require mechanicalmovementinputs for function (which is ALL of them) begin to degrade and break-down.As the parts of the system run down, movement stops feeling quite as good. Maybe eventually it actually feels bad (like when we get injured).At the heart of WHY movement stops feeling good is because one of the most crucial body components that degrades is our ability to feel ourselves....aka, the literal ability to notice sensation.When you cant feel yourself clearly, on a sensation level, your brain is blind to all the possible ways you might find to move.And with that blindness, the idea of movement gets less and less bright, exciting, pleasurable, motivating; in contrast, when the brain can see all the sensations of your body, it can find the most effective, most fun, best way to move YOUR body.So what's the antidote? How do we reverse this negative sensation doom spiral....? We give the body more information, especially at it's edges. Which means, we give the body more experience (moving/working/training) at end range.By introducing the body to it's 'boundaries' (the full range of motion of all of your joints), your brain now has a ton of useful, actionable information about what's possible to do in the world around it (aka around YOU). Over time, and given enough information, your brain will absolutely figure out your particular movement need, your WHAT; my job is to help your brain get the information it needs to do this magic.If moving and changing your body in this way sounds exciting or interesting Id love to set up a call with you.

        "raw_content": "One of the factors we take into account with each new client is their learning style.Are they a visual learner - Can they replicate a movement after watching it?Do they process verbal instruction - can they hear a cue and change their movement?Do they respond well to tactile cues - are they comfortable being touched, and does it help them understand the movement?We also find that it is essential for the coach to understand where the client is on their learning trajectory. Studies have shown that there are four stages to learning a new skill. Understanding which stage each of our clients is at, helps us adjust our teaching style to suit that client's needs.\"Initially described as \"Four Stages for Learning Any New Skill\", the theory was developed at Gordon Training Internationalby its employee Noel Burch in the 1970s. The stages are described as follows:Unconscious incompetenceThe individual does not understand or know how to do something and does not necessarily recognize the deficit. They may deny the usefulness of the skill. The individual must recognize their own incompetence, and the value of the new skill, before moving on to the next stage.[2]The length of time an individual spends in this stage depends on the strength of the stimulus to learn.[3]Conscious incompetenceThough the individual does not understand or know how to do something, he or she does recognize the deficit, as well as the value of a new skill in addressing the deficit. The making of mistakes can be integral to the learning process at this stage.[4]Conscious competenceThe individual understands or knows how to do something. However, demonstrating the skill or knowledge requires concentration. It may be broken down into steps, and there is heavy conscious involvement in executing the new skill.[3]Unconscious competenceThe individual has had so much practice with a skill that it has become \"second nature\" and can be performed easily. As a result, the skill can be performed while executing another task. The individual may be able to teach it to others, depending upon how and when it was learned.\"",
